0,Real,"Democrats Hope Trump's Cabinet Picks Will Stand in Their Own Way With Democrats unable to stop President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet picks on their own, they're hoping that increased scrutiny on his nominees will do it for them.  As the minority party in the Senate with little real recourse at their disposal, uncovering something disqualifying may be Democrats' last best hope to block some Trump selections that they view as unacceptable and outside the political mainstream.  Even if they don't have the votes to shoot down any nominees, Democratic senators will grill them in committee hearings. They can slow the confirmation process with procedural moves or try to shame them  all in the service of trying to peel off the three Republican votes they would need to kill a nomination or force the Trump White House to withdraw the pick.  Not all of Trump's picks will face such aggressive scrutiny, which Democrats insist is not merely reflexive partisan opposition. Retired Gen. James Mattis is expected to sail through his confirmation to be defense secretary, even though his recent tenure in the active-duty military means he'll need a special waiver that requires 60 votes in the Senate.  But some of Trump's picks, Democrats say, represent existential threats to the basic mission of the departments they've been tapped to lead, and so the nominees have no business in those jobs.  There's Trump's reported pick for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, chief executive of oil giant ExxonMobil, who has warm relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. There's Trump's pick to head the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, who has made a name for himself by suing the agency. There's Andy Puzder, Trump's choice for the Labor Department, a fast food executive who wants to replace workers with robots.  There's Betsy DeVos, a school choice advocate seen as hostile to public education, whom Trump wants to put in charge of the Education Department. And there's attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions, an anti-immigration hard-liner whom the Senate once rejected for a federal judgeship over past racially insensitive comments.   Democratic congressional aides and outside groups will spend the coming weeks poring over the financial statements, personal histories and public utterances of Trump's most polarizing Cabinet selections, hoping to find information that could turn them into the next Tom Daschle or Zoe Baird  Barack Obama and Bill Clinton Cabinet nominees who were forced to withdraw after damaging issues came to light during the confirmation process.  And Democrats have reason to believe Trump's nominees provide an especially rich vein for digging, because according to reports, few have been subjected to a traditionally thorough vetting process by his transition team. Many are wealthy business executives with sprawling financial entanglements and no political experience or the scrutiny that comes with it.  ""What's unusual about Trump's Cabinet picks is that so few of them come from politics, which means that they're going to have a harder time than usual going through the traditional vet and public evaluation,"" said Simon Rosenberg, president of the Democratic think tank NDN. ""Some of them are going to crash. Some of them aren't going to make it because of things that are going to come up in their background.""  Democrats will have to pick their battles, and priorities will likely be decided based not only by how threatening they find Trump's nominees, but how vulnerable the nominees are after some digging.  Related: Donald Trump Builds Cabinet with Old Friends and Some Rivals  ""Much of it depends on what's uncovered in the vetting process,"" said Jim Manley, a former aide to Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada. ""As Senator Daschle found out, one little thing can trip you up.""  Daschle was nominated to head the Department of Health and Human Services in 2009 but removed his name after controversy over his taxes emerged.  Old domestic abuse allegations related to a messy divorce have already surfaced with Puzder. But complicated financial issues are more likely to trip up Trump's nominees than personal indiscretions, especially given the number of super-wealthy candidates Trump has chosen.  ""The Senate Finance Committee has developed a reputation as somewhat of a killing field for nominees in recent years,"" Manley said. ""They've developed the experience to really pick apart the financials.""  And Trump's team may be flying blind to some extent. His transition team has reportedly forgone the rigorous vetting process traditionally performed on potential nominees before they are announced publicly, leaving his picks potentially vulnerable to surprises.  Selecting Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-kansas, as CIA director was ""pretty simple,"" said Rep. Devin Nunes, R-California, who is working on Trump's transition team.  ""They asked me who would be the person for the agency, and I said without a doubt that Pompeo would be a great pick,"" Nunes told Politico.  Dan Kanninen, a former Obama White House official who helped choose candidates for jobs in the Environmental Protection Agency, said it takes weeks or months for even the best transition teams to properly vet candidates.  ""With Trump, none of that, as far as we can tell, happened before the election. And now, if it is happening at all, it's happening in a matter of days based on the gut on the president-elect,"" he said. ""It would not surprise me at all, given how little we know  and frankly how little the Trump team knows  if something came up with of a magnitude that might kill some of their nominations.""  Even under the best of circumstances, things get missed. Clinton rescinded Baird's nomination to be attorney general because it was discovered that she had hired an undocumented immigrant as a nanny.  The Senate confirmation process can be brutal even for squeaky clean candidates who have spent their whole careers in government. A ""Survivor's Guide for Presidential Nominees"" prepared by the National Academy of Public Administration, a congressionally chartered non-profit, stretches over 71 pages and warns, ""If you are not nervous going into your confirmation hearing, you should be.""  Nov. 24: Trump Scrutinized Over Cabinet Picks, Intelligence Briefings 2:38 It may be especially bumpy for Trump's nominees from the private sector, who are not accustomed to government processes and who have not already gone through the kind of public and legal scrutiny politicians and government officials are used to.  Three years ago, facing Republican obstruction, Senate Democrats decided to kill the filibuster for executive branch appointments, which means they now cannot force Republicans to find the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster. Republicans need only 51 votes in the Senate to confirm Trump's Cabinet picks.  Democrats would need three Republicans to join them to shoot down any of Trump's nominees, and so far none have expressed interest in taking up the cause.  Some Democrats, unsurprisingly, are having buyer's remorse about the filibuster change, including Reid's successor as Democratic Leader, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York.  ""I wanted 60 for Supreme Court and Cabinet, but I didn't prevail,"" Schumer told The Washington Post.  Still, he vowed opposition to some nominees, however possible. ""If it's somebody who is out of the mainstream,"" Schumer said, ""we'll fight tooth and nail and use every tool we have.""  The Senate has traditionally deferred to new presidents' wishes in filling out their Cabinets, approving many nominees without bothering to even take formal votes.  Recent incoming presidents have had to withdraw only one or two Cabinet picks, if any at all, and the Senate has voted to outright reject just three nominees in the past 100 years, according to the Senate historian.  But Democrats are in no mood to be deferential to Trump after Republicans, in their view, broke with tradition by obstructing Obama Supreme Court pick Merrick Garland for nine months and fought the confirmation of his second attorney general, Loretta Lynch.  And they say Trump has chosen blatantly provocative or unqualified nominees, instead of trying to find common ground in a divided country.  ""Donald Trump is kind of giving a big middle finger to that entire department by nominating someone who was found to have 50 percent of his restaurants in noncompliance with labor laws,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, told MSNBC on Friday of Trump's decision to name Puzder to head the department responsible for protecting workers."
1,Satire,"TRUMP SAYS HE HEROICALLY AVOIDED CAPTURE IN VIETNAM BY STAYING IN U.S.s AMES, IOWA (The Borowitz Report)Presidential candidate Donald Trump revealed a little-known episode of personal heroism from his youth on Saturday, telling an Iowa audience that he narrowly avoided capture in Vietnam by remaining in the United States for the duration of the war.  The Cong were after me, Trump said, visibly stirred by the memory. And then, just in the nick of time, I got my deferment.  The former reality-show star said he had never shared his record as a war hero before because I dont like to boast.  He said that he only disclosed the episode now because the way this nation treats our deferment veterans is a disgrace.  Trump complained that he received no official commendation or medal for his heroism, calling the lack of recognition shameful.  Those brave Americans who, like me, avoided being captured by not serving at allwe are the true heroes, he said.  Trumps tale of valor appeared to move many members of his audience, some of whom waited in line after his speech to thank him for his lack of service."
2,Fake,"Obama Signs Executive Order Banning The Pledge Of Allegiance In Schools Nationwide WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP)  Early this morning, President Obama made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency with the signing of Executive Order 13738, which revokes the federal governments official recognition of the Pledge of Allegiance. Under the new order, it is now illegal for any federally funded agency to display the pledge or for any federal employee to recite, or encourage others to recite, the pledge while on duty. This law also applies to federal contractors and other institutions that receive federal funding such as public schools. Individuals who violate this order can face fines of up to $10,000 and up to one year in federal prison.    During the press conference, the President explained his decision was based on a personal belief that the language used in the pledge is divisive and contrary to Americas deepest held values.  The pledge excludes so many Americans who are vital to making this country what it is, Obama said. Asking someone to pledge their allegiance to our country excludes Jehovahs Witnesses, Amish, Muslims, and many others whose religious beliefs prohibit strong displays of nationalism. By calling this one nation under God, we exclude the millions of hard working atheists and agnostics who call America home. By saying liberty and justice for all, we ignore the grievances of millions of Hispanics, African Americans and Muslims who feel they have neither liberty nor justice.  Obama told reporters that he believes the inclusion of under God runs afoul of the First Amendments establishment clause. He summed up his press briefing by challenging congress to create a new pledge that more accurately reflects Americas values.  I am willing to rescind my decision here today and allow the Pledge of Allegiance back into the schools if we can all agree on the creation of a new Pledge, something that is includes everyones beliefs and not just the belief of one nationality or faith.  Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has already offered her support of president Obamas decree and has vowed to uphold the order if she wins in Novembers general election. She echoed his concerns about the pledges language and suggested that the pledges mention of God sends the wrong message to Americas children.  I fully support the President and the decision that he has made here today. In January, when I take office as the next President of the United States, unless I see otherwise, I will do my best to uphold this new law and ensure that it stays in effect.  Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump did not mince words when voicing his contempt for the presidents order, referring to the president as an illegitimate Muslim traitor.    As a Christian nation, the Pledge of Allegiance helps our children be the greatest children out there, the best there is, greater than all the other children in this world combined. Obama, who founded ISIS by the way, wants them not to be great, he wants them to be weak, and by banning the Pledge of Allegiance in our schools, he has proven that here today. This is the first step in many in his master plan to force Sharia law onto this great country of ours before he leaves office in January. We all must remember that this is one nation under God and not some guy and his beliefs in whatever he chooses to believe.  Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, spoke to ABC News about the ban.  This is a story about President Obama banning the Pledge of Allegiance in our schools. Bradley said. I just want to say a big thanks to every God-fearing, Patriotic American that has supported our cause that gives brand new socks to the homeless. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps so much.  Lawrence Ketchum of the Secular Coalition for America told reporters that Obamas decision to ban the Pledge is a victory for all those who oppose government control.  When our children are forced to chant, One nation under God, whose God are they referring to exactly? Ketchum said, From birth, children are indoctrinated and subjected to mind control, efforts to shape them into the perfect beings that society wants them to be. The Pledge of Allegiance is just one of the many tools used in a childs involuntary reeducation of basic beliefs and values. Ketchum continued, This is a great day not just for Atheists, but for all Americans who value freedom. Forcing children to pledge blind allegiance to this country and profess a belief in a God is extremely dangerous in developing young minds and amounts to little more than government mind control.  While Executive Order 13738 is likely to be a source of heated debate among Americans, constitutional scholar, Paul Horner, told ABC News that it is unlikely the law will be challenged in court.  Since this law only affects federal employees and contractors and not the general populace, it is well within the traditional scope of a presidents executive authority to pass this law. Any challenges would lack proper legal standing and more than like be quickly dismissed.    Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told ABC News he believes in what Utah is doing.  It is important that children become the unique individuals that this country wants them to be. Conforming into the perfect little human beings that God intended them to be has always been the American way. It is important to remember that our Lord and Savior loves each and every one of us, unless we masturbate, then well burn in Hell for eternity.  David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate aricles they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.  You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the sex reassignment surgery my wife Barbara always wanted since she was a little boy, Mikkleson said. We claim to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well, but thats just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and thats it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and Im only telling you this for legal reasons. Mikkleson continues, A typical story of ours makes wild claims, using grammatical errors, misspellings and words like umimumimaginative, recycled, hoax, saying that a story illegally appropriates the trademarks of legitimate news organizations, but we list no links or sources of information, they are all just outrageous accusations by us. And that story will get 50,000 shares or more on Facebook, thats a lot of ad revenue for only writing a couple sentences. Mikkelson further explains, It is common for us to rewrite a story were debunking if we dont like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a persons name from the original article and then called him a liar, its so funny! We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search will show that our disclaimer is 100% fabricated. Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money, Mikkelson laughs. And lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours. Our writers like Zarronandia go as far as to say that the story originated from a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false news stories. But we dont list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up our claims; Its just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and as I said before, I only tell you this for legal reasons. I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work?  Originally composed by Colonel George Balch in 1887, The Pledge of Allegiance was later revised by Francis Bellamy in 1892 and formally adopted by Congress in 1942. The Pledge is an expression of allegiance to the Flag of the United States and the republic of the United States of America. The official name of the Pledge of Allegiance was adopted in 1945 and the last changes made to it came on Flag Day in 1954 when the words under God were added at a nursing school where CNA classes in Ann Arbor, Michigan were taking place.  The Obama Administration has set up a 24-hour hotline to address any questions and concerns the public may have regarding the new Executive Order. The number for the hotline is (785) 273-0325. Donald Trump plans to speak about the new law this Thursday night (October 20th) at 10PM at The Lost Leaf in Phoenix, Arizona."
3,Real,"GOP in Congress split over how to repeal Obamacare WASHINGTON  Republicans are united on repealing President Barack Obamas health care law, but ideologically and practically speaking, theyre in different camps over replacing it. Getting the factions together wont be easy.  Some Republicans would revise and rebrand Obamacare,  junking unpopular provisions like its requirement that most Americans carry health insurance, while preserving well-liked parts. Others would rip up the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, and not replace it.  Can Congress put aside differences in the new year? Play VIDEO Can Congress put aside differences in the new year? President-elect Donald Trump and Republican congressional leaders will have to unite the groups on complicated changes affecting the financial and physical well-being of millions of people. For some constituents in fragile health, its literally a life-and-death debate.  Republicans have a really narrow path, says Grace-Marie Turner of the Galen Institute, a free-market health care research organization. Theyve got to deal with the politics of this, theyve got to make sure they come up with good policy, and they also have process challenges.  Success is not guaranteed, and Republicans may come to regret that their party defined itself as totally opposed to Obamacare.  Yet House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady seems unfazed by the challenge. Its like tax reform, says Brady, a Texas Republican, explaining that many pieces will be pulled together. Unlike Obamacare, which ripped up the individual market, this will be done deliberately, in an appropriate timetable.  Republicans say they will move quickly to repeal the ACA, while suspending the effective date to allow them to craft a replacement. Heres a look at the GOP camps and whos in them:  Revise and rebrand  Many Republicans may quietly be in this contingent, but fear being accused of promoting Obamacare-lite.  Theyd strip out some of the ACAs taxes and requirements. The unpopular individual mandate to carry health insurance or risk fines could be replaced with other persuasion short of a government dictate. Rules on insurers would be loosened.  But popular provisions such as protecting those with pre-existing health conditions would be retained in some form, as well as financial assistance for low- and moderate-income people. The requirement that health plans cover adult children until age 26 would be fairly easy to preserve, since employers have accommodated it.  A rebranded version of Obamas law may well cover fewer people. But its GOP advocates believe most Americans will find their goal of universal access to care politically acceptable when measured against the Democratic ideal of universal coverage, underwritten by government.  Many GOP allies in the business community favor revising the ACA. That includes major players among hospitals, insurers and pharmaceuticals.  Trump may have given this group some cover by saying that he wants to keep parts of the law, but his bottom line remains unknown.  Budget hawks  For budget hawks, unwinding the Obama health law is a beginning. Next they could move on to much bigger objectives like restructuring Medicaid and Medicare, and placing a cost-conscious limit on tax breaks for employer coverage.  Budget hawks see health care as the main driver of government deficits, and they are loath to address that imbalance by raising taxes. Instead they want to rewrite the social compact so individuals accept more responsibility and risk for their health care.  House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin is the most prominent member of this camp, and his Better Way agenda is its roadmap. Georgia Rep. Tom Price, Trumps nominee for Health and Human Services, is a budget hawk. Vice President-elect Mike Pence has been in the same orbit throughout his career.  The problem for budget hawks is that the 2016 political campaign did not give them a mandate. Issues like Medicare and Medicaid were scarcely discussed. Trump said he wouldnt cut Medicare, and sent conflicting signals on Medicaid.  Many Democrats cant wait for Republicans to follow the call of the budget hawks. Betting that will backfire, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is rallying her lawmakers against attacks on the ACA and Medicare.  The rip-it-up society  The most conservative lawmakers want to pull Obamacare up by the roots as if it never existed, says Republican political consultant Frank Luntz. That sentiment is embodied by the 40 or so members of the House Freedom Caucus, and its probably broadly shared among conservatives.  Some do not believe the federal government should be involved in health care, and they couldnt care less about replacing the ACA.  They would say that Obamas plan has failed, said Luntz.  GOP leaders may need these lawmakers to advance on replacement legislation; coaxing them to a middle ground might not be possible.  Trump calls the ACA a disaster, and thats pleasing to those farthest on the right. Its unclear if hed walk their walk.  Pragmatists  At the core of this small group are legislative veterans who understand the excruciating difficulties of getting major bills to a presidents desk. GOP Sens. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Susan Collins of Maine are pragmatists.  They may find support from Republican governors who expanded Medicaid under the health law. GOP congressional leaders could gravitate to this camp.  The biggest challenge for pragmatists will be to win over some Democrats for replacement legislation. While repealing most of Obamacare is possible with a simple majority in the Senate, 60 votes would probably be needed for a replacement. There will only be 52 GOP senators next year.  Republicans need a fancy Rose Garden repeal ceremony...and I expect them to have one, said Dan Mendelson, CEO of the consulting firm Avalere Health. On the other hand, theres 20 million people with health insurance under the ACA, and they dont want to dump them. Theres no clear path for how to square that conflict."
4,Satire,"Trump Reveals Plans To Be Sworn In On Copy Of Playboy Magazine NEW YORK, NYDuring his Sunday interview with 60 Minutes, president-elect Donald Trump revealed that he has arranged to be sworn into the White House on January 20 on a copy of Playboy Magazine, rather than the traditional Bible as most past presidents have done.  Sources were able to confirm that he plans to use the March 1990 issue of the magazine, with Trump himself of the cover, on which he will swear while delivering the sacred oath of office to the nation.  Tremendous magazine, Playboy. The best magazine. Its got beautiful women in it. I love beautiful women, President-elect Trump told reporter Leslie Stahl in the interview.  The Biblelook, we all know I love the Bible, but to be honest with you, its a little boring. No pictures. It talks about women, some, but no pictures, Trump continued. He further stated that the raunchy pornographic magazine lined up more closely with his values than the Bible, which has some real nasty things to say about me.  White House transitional teams confirmed the news, and further stated Trumps inauguration will include an open bar, craps tables, and go-go dancers."

Trump has been in the public eye for long time   and yet every single one of his accusers waited until within one month of a national election to come forward? Theyre all aware of how wealthy the man is, and couldve come forward years (or in some cases, decades) ago and walked away with nice settlements if their claims were true. The fact that they didnt bother to do so gives me the impression that theyre looking for attention  or to sway the election.

6,Real,"Sen. Jeff Sessions Faces Fight Over Bid to Be Trump's Attorney General The battle over President-elect Donald Trump's attorney general nominee, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, is heating up ahead of what promises to be a deeply contested confirmation hearing next year.  Groups on the left are ratcheting up their criticism of Sessions on issues such as immigration, criminal justice and voting rights while those supporting him are unveiling the first component of what is expected to be a vigorous campaign in his favor. His confirmation hearings are scheduled for January 10 and 11 before the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Play Racism concerns surround Sessions as AG pick Facebook Twitter Google Plus Embed Racism concerns surround Sessions as AG pick 9:30 The conservative Judicial Crisis Network on Thursday launched a website, ConfirmSessions, accompanied by a six-figure ad-buy touting the Alabama senator as someone who will enforce the law.  The digital ads, targeting the Washington, D.C. market, show clips of Trump praising Sessions and highlighting his experience as U.S. attorney in Alabama and then senator of the southern state.  ""From his time as U.S. Attorney to his tenure as attorney general for the state of Alabama, Jeff Sessions successfully prosecuted drug and violent criminals, corrupt politicians and white collar offenders and his record shows an absolute commitment to equal justice under law by putting the people first  not powerful special interests,"" said Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network.  Related: Trump Taps Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for Attorney General Post  Now the battle lines are being drawn over his nomination.  Sessions has a controversial past on issues of race and immigration, including his failed confirmation of a federal judgeship 30 years ago largely because of racially insensitive remarks.  In the 1980s, Sessions was considered for a Ronald Reagan-appointed federal district judgeship in Alabama, but was blocked by the Senate after a black former deputy, Thomas Figures, accused him of making racially insensitive statements. Figures said that Sessions called him ""boy"" and had once warned him to be careful about what he said to ""white folks."" Sessions denied the remarks under oath at the time. In addition, U.S. Attorney E.T. Rolison and Assistant U.S. Attorney Ginny Grenade - two people Figures said were in the room at the time of the alleged remarks -- signed affidavits saying they did not hear Sessions call Figures ""boy."" Grenade signed the affidavit in 1986 and Rolison signed one on December 8 of 2016.  Figures, a former assistant U.S. Attorney in Alabama, also testified that, during a 1981 murder investigation tied to the Ku Klux Klan, Sessions commented that he ""used to think they [the KKK] were OK"" until he found out some were ""pot smokers."" Sessions claimed he had been joking.  Now, progressives are pouncing.  The progressive group People for the American Way has drawn attention to missing information that Sessions failed to include in a vast questionnaire that he is required to fill out ahead of his confirmation hearings.  In a 10-page memo that outlines Sessions' omissions, PFAW notes that in response to questions about his public statements, Sessions listed 48 opinion articles that he wrote. But the group found 43 more. He also didn't include any of the 60 press releases from 2003 and 2004, including one on the Federal Marriage Amendment, according to the group. Nor did Sessions make mention of his failed nomination to be a federal judge from 20 years ago.  1986: NBC Reports On Jeff Sessions' Confirmation Hearing 3:55 ""Sessions' questionnaire is grossly incomplete  we've found hundreds of relevant missing documents in just a few days,"" said Marge Baker, executive vice president of People for the American Way. ""It's ridiculous to think that the Senate could possibly give thorough consideration to a nominee with this many holes in his questionnaire.""  In response, Sessions submitted two additional pages of information on Thursday, including the listing of his judicial nomination.  Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, the incoming ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is urging Republicans to delay the confirmation hearing.  In a letter to the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Feinstein suggested that a delay of the hearings might be necessary for two reasons: Sessions' incomplete questionnaire and the reams of information that the committee must investigate in less than a month. She noted that Sessions has more than 30 years of public service and public statements that must be analyzed, and the 150,000 pages of information he handed over, while not a complete accounting, is too much to assess before January 10.  ""Staff must have sufficient time to do the due diligence on any nominee for this vital position  and this due diligence will likely take longer than the review for recent, prior nominees who had less materials to analyze,"" Feinstein wrote.  Drew Courtney, communications director for PFAW, said: ""No matter who the nominee is, the confirmation process for an attorney general needs to be taken seriously; Given Donald Trump's dismissive attitude towards the Constitution, that's doubly true this year. Senator Grassley is doing the country a real disservice by trying to rush the process.""  But Sen. Grassley has indicated that he has no intention of postponing the hearings. ""It is no surprise that Senator Sessions' twenty years of service as our colleaguenot to mention his service in the Department of Justice and to the State of Alabamayielded an extensive record,"" Grassley wrote in a letter responding to Feinstein.  Severino defended Sessions in a statement. ""Senator Sessions has turned over more material than any nominee in history and is well known to the senators. Liberals are scrambling to delay because they don't want an attorney general who puts the American people and the rule of law ahead of political agendas,"" Severino said.  This first battle is likely a sign of more conflicts to come over Sessions' nomination as the hearings approach."

Here are grown men, candidates running for President of the United States, and theyre acting like 4-year-olds. Theyre up there on stage, broadcasted to the entire world, calling each other names, interrupting each other, making complete fools of themselves and I just thought to myself; I think the American people deserve better than this. I know we deserve better than this because we are better than this.  Political analyst, Paul Horner, told ABC News he has taken an extreme interest in what Murray is doing since he announced his run for President just a little more than a week ago.    I dont know if Bill Murray is really running for President or if hes just having some fun, but the man is making some excellent points out there. Hes getting people to think about the state their country is in right now and making a lot of people happy while doing it. I applaud Mr. Murray for what hes doing.  I pretty much dont like any of the candidates that are running for President right now, Murray told the crowd, I think Bernie Sanders seems like a decent guy, but the rest of em, are pretty much complete pond scum in my opinion. Murray continued, Im always traveling around the world, but Im proud to call America, the good ole U.S. of A, my home. I think theres a lot of great people here, a lot of potential, but theres also a lot of confusion and hate right now. People dont know what to make of these Hitler wanna-bes like Donald Trump, and the Ted Cruzs, who want to start World War III. They feed on the hate and paranoia a lot of this country has, and because of that, you see them leading in the polls. And its sad that people go along with it, and cant see it for what it really is.  Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she fully supports Murray and his run for President.  We need a new face in Washington. Someone who has no political ties or agenda and cant be bought, Bradley said. I actually met Bill Murray a while back when we were starting our cause that gives new socks to the homeless. Bill made a donation right there on the spot, saying what we were doing was amazing; hes such a great guy. He truly cares about people and making the world a better place.  Murray finished the rally by saying, Im no hero, I just want to help out, and I hope you all choose to stand behind me, or beside me, or wherever is comfortable for you, but just as long as its with me. Look, we dont need to make America great again, because it already is; we all just need to try a little bit harder and have more love in our hearts for our fellow man. I think if you can take care of yourself and then maybe take care of someone else then thats sort of how youre supposed to live. Lets all help each other make this the best life experience possible!  Murray still has yet to announce if he will be running as an Republican, Democrat or Independent.  David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes, a website that takes the fun out of stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.  This type of story, when it goes viral, and we debunk it, we make money, Mikkelson said. The secret behind a good Snopes article is a formula that we have used since day one, its actually quite simple. First, we start with the same cookie-cutter outline we use for every site that we debunk. Next, we copy and paste parts of the original article into ours. After that, one of our writers will type one or two sentences that talk about the content we just copy and pasted. And now, last but not least, we slap a title on there similar to the articles headline that were debunking. This way it will show up at the top of Google for anyone searching for that story, and thats it! Then we just sit back and let the money roll in. We are the absolute definition of clickbait! Ill tell what, if it wasnt for great writers like Internet news satirist Paul Horner, putting out the stories that he does, my children wouldnt have been able to go to college. Holding back tears, Mikkelson finishes by saying, Though we are currently being sued by Fox News for calling them a fake news site, so lets just hope Paul Horner writes another story soon.  Murrays campaign team told reporters their next stop is the Arizona State Capitol on March 2nd and then the Tempe Improv later that night. It is rumored Murray will be at the Improv meeting with locals and telling a few jokes. Tickets to that show are only $10."
10,Real,"Trump Team Asks State Dept. To Name Those Working On Gender Equality President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has asked the State Department to list its workers who focus on gender equality and ending violence against women, in what's being seen as an echo of an earlier request for the Energy Department to list employees who work on climate change.  In a brief email that was sent Wednesday morning, the Trump team asked the State Department's bureaus and offices to list any programs or activities that ""promote gender equality, such as ending gender-based violence, promoting women's participation in economic and political spheres, entrepreneurship, etc.""  The email was acquired and published by The New York Times, which reports:  ""Although the wording of the memo is neutral and does not hint at any policy change, it rattled State Department employees, even those at senior levels. Some officials said they feared that the incoming Trump administration was trying to determine what programs were focused on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues, though the memo did not refer to them."" The team also asked the department offices to ""note positions whose primary functions are to promote such issues"" and to highlight any funds for the current financial year that are ""already allocated to such programs and activities.""  Affirming the Times' characterization of the email's reception, The Los Angeles Times quotes a senior State Department official who said, ""People are freaked out.""  Update 9 a.m. ET Friday: Trump Team's Response  In a statement about the request, the Trump transition team says:  ""President-elect Trump will ensure the rights of women across the world are valued and protected. To help fulfill this promise, the transition team inquired about existing programs at the State department that helps foster gender equality, ends gender-based violence, and promotes economic and political participationfinding ways to improve them, along with hundreds of other requests."" Our original post continues:  The topic also came up at Thursday's daily State Department briefing  but NPR's Michele Kelemen says it seemed that spokesman John Kirby mainly sought to calm nerves about the request.  In a report for our Newscast unit, Michele quotes Kirby as saying, ""To the degree that there is interest in the way that we have approached pursuing gender equality and human rights around the world by the transition team, we will certainly provide them the context, the information that is appropriate for them to make their own decisions going forward.""  Kirby acknowledged that there could be ""anxiety"" at a time of transition, but he refused to go into details about the email or to verify the accuracy of the leaked documents.  Addressing his agency's approach to gender issues, Kirby told a reporter, ""Obviously, gender equality issues here at the Department of State are a priority. Secretary Kerry has made them a priority; Secretary Clinton before him made it a priority, and it remains one for us here.""  Kirby also suggested that the State Department might balk at naming its employees who have worked on those priorities, saying that in a hypothetical case, ""if there were issue-specific names requested, obviously that would be of concern to us and it would not be the kind of information that we would deem to be appropriate to be passed along.""  Shortly after the transition team's email became public, the Twitter account of the State Department's Political-Military Affairs bureau posted a note of support for the National Action Plan on Women, Peace, & Security  a program that was celebrated in a State Department tweet Wednesday, as the agency marked five years since the plan was introduced by President Obama.  In response to reports about the memo, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued a statement saying in part:  ""In light of previous requests made by the Trump transition team, today's report that the incoming administration is requesting all information related to State Department programs that promote gender equality is concerning and the transition team should clarify their intent.... Women and girls' equality is transformative for communities and economies, and the existing State Department programs have achieved great successes to advance education access for girls, protect women from trafficking, end child marriage, and combat gender-based violence."" The Trump team's request, which set a deadline of Wednesday afternoon to produce the lists, comes one week after the Energy Department rebuffed a request from Trump's transition team to name employees working on climate change.  As NPR's Brakkton Booker has reported, the Trump team's 74-point questionnaire on climate change ""raised fears among civil rights lawyers specializing in federal worker whistleblower protections, who say the incoming administration is at a minimum trying to influence or limit the research.""  In refusing the Trump team's request, the Energy Department said many of its staff members were ""unsettled"" by the gesture, stating that while it would share any information that was already public, it would not produce a list of individual names.  Early last week, Trump said he is nominating Exxon Mobil Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson to lead the State Department."
11,Fake,"Another Person Investigating The Clintons Turns Up Dead Today, a young woman working for an anti-child trafficking organization was laid to rest.  Her name was Monica Petersen, and she turned up dead in Haiti on Sunday after posting I Found A Smoking Gun on social media.  Her friends and family are calling foul as her family cannot get believable information from Haitian authorities, and Ms. Petersen just happened to publicly post some reports that implicate the Clintons involvement in alleged human trafficking via a mine run by Hillary Clintons brother Tony Rodham.  A compilation of the various threads from reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Imgur and more can be found on the Reddit The Donald page here.   Go figure.  Just like any number of people either close to the Clintons or investigating them who could possibly end up a material witness during a trial, Ms. Petersen ends up dead.  This, for those following the fake news propaganda coming out of globalists, leftists, and the disgraced legacy media, is why there is a Clinton Body Count.  Monica Petersens name may well be added to it.   According to several reports, Haiti has been a nexus for child trafficking for a number of years.  In fact, found in the thousands of emails released by WikiLeaks from John Podestas email account, information surfaced that Hillary Clinton assisted a Haitian woman, Laura Silsby, known to be involved in child trafficking in 2010 when she was caught trying to take 33 children  not orphans  out of Haiti.  The two womens history is known to reach back at least fifteen years.  Also in the Podesta emails are several archaic conversations about pizza that have taken on the aura of internet lore (what some call conspiracy theories) known as #pizzagate, and reportedly is the tip of the iceberg in an international child trafficking ring.  The rabbit hole gets very deep when one considers how many times Bill Clinton is known to have traveled Jeffrey Epsteins private child molestation island.  Did Monica Petersen get too close? A tenacious young woman investigating one of the most egregious crimes any human can commit, if she got too close to the criminal element and was known to them, it is a definite possibility.  A good friend of hers named Bella claims she found out what happened and is refusing to elaborate on public next-pagemessaging boards.  Whatever the case is, the people around the Clintons and those investigating them sure do tend to end up dead."
12,Satire,"Sunny Saves Bo From Mountain Lion During Cross-Country Journey To Reunite With Obamas GARDINER, MTFending off the large wildcat moments before it could harm her best friend, presidential pet Sunny reportedly saved fellow first dog Bo from a mountain lion attack last month as they journeyed across the country to find their way back to the Obama family.  Sources said the White Houses two canine residents, who were accidentally left behind by the first family during a trip to Yellowstone National Park, encountered the mountain lion while making their way through the Montana wilderness. According to reports, Bo, who had become separated from his companion earlier in the day when he slid into a ravine, was cornered by the predator against a large tree trunk and seemed to have no means of escape until Sunny, having seemingly appeared out of nowhere, came rushing to his aid at the last possible second.  Bo, get out of the way! said Sunny, her teeth bared and her fur bristling as she lunged toward the menacing cougar, ultimately scaring it back into the forest. Thats right! Run away, you coward! Nobodys going to hurt my friend while Im around!  Dont worry, Bo, she added. Youre safe now.  Administration officials said the two Portuguese water dogs were mistakenly left in Yellowstone by the vacationing Obamas, who returned home believing Sunny and Bo had been loaded aboard Air Force One, never realizing the pair had scampered off the tarmac and into the woods moments before takeoff to chase a squirrel. It is believed that the dogs later returned to the spot where they had last scented Barack, Michelle, Malia, and Sasha Obama and, after sitting patiently overnight until realizing the family was not going to return, decided to find their way back to Washington, D.C. on their own, beginning a 2,000-mile journey eastward.  The first pets reportedly spent the next few days bounding over mountain passes and wading through rocky streams, from which Bo would, after several fruitless attempts, emerge with a fish in his mouth, providing much-needed sustenance to the pair, who were accustomed to being fed nutritious meals at regular intervals by their White House handlers. Early on in their trek, Sunny and Bo are said to have encountered several hikers they thought might rescue them. However, the group turned out to be German tourists who, reportedly failing to recognize the presidential seal on the dogs collars, simply pet them, fed them some dried fruit, and continued on their way.  What do you think theyre eating at the state dinner tonight? Bo asked a tired, disinterested Sunny as the two crouched inside a hollow tree trunk where they had been forced to take shelter during a particularly fierce storm. I bet theyre having steak. Oh, man, I can almost taste it now. Thats my absolute favorite. Do you think Malia is saving her leftovers for me? I bet she is.  I miss Washington, Bo continued. Well be back home soon, though, right?  According to sources, rarely a day of their adventure went by without the two dogs getting into a precarious situation that required them to rely on each other to get through. At one point, after traveling for a day without water, Sunny reportedly came upon a rushing river and, in her eagerness to take a drink, slipped on a rock, fell in, and was swept away by the powerful current. Bo is believed to have reached the rivers edge just in time to see Sunnys head pop up and disappear around the bend. With neither dog having much swimming experience outside the White House pool, sources said a quick-thinking Bo ran downstream as fast as he could, grabbed one end of a long stick in his jaws, extended it out over the water, had Sunny bite down on the other end, and managed to pull her to safety just before she would have plunged over a waterfall.  Several weeks later, sources reported that a curious Bo followed an unusual scent into a hollow log lying on its side in the Black Hills, only to come scrambling out moments later pursued by a slowly ambling porcupine. Bo is said to have spent the rest of the evening whimpering as Sunny carefully removed the quills stuck in her companions muzzle using her teeth, at one point pausing to say, You have to go and stick your nose in everything, dont you?  Cold and hungry as they crossed through barren, wintry terrain, the first dogs were reportedly found trudging through chest-deep snow by a kindly old man who let them stay for a time in his small and humble cabin, surroundings that were far removed from the accommodations that Sunny, who was purchased from a professional breeder, and Bo, who was a gift from the late Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA), were used to. According to reports, the old man allowed the pair to join his team of sled dogs, who initially bullied the White House pets for their pampered backgrounds.  You call yourselves dogs, do you? said Avalanche, a hulking husky and the lead dog on the old mans sled team. Something tells me youve had everything in life handed to you on a silver dog dish. That may be the way things work in Washington, D.C., but around here we have to earn our keep. This is no place for lapdogs.  Later, sources stated, Sunny and Bo earned the respect of that same dog when they worked together to save several members of the sled team who had fallen through a patch of thin ice during a routine supply run.  Unbeknownst to the pair as they made their way across the country, the Obamas were said to be desperately trying to locate the pets they missed so much. According to sources, Sasha and Malia Obama put up flyers all around the nations capital and asked every congressman they encountered to keep an eye out for the dogs in their home districts. Reports indicate that Sasha also went to bed each night looking at an old photo of her beloved pets, promising aloud that they would all be reunited one day.  As the first dogs passed through the Midwest on their trek homeward, they reportedly came upon a small city where, much to their delight, they heard the unmistakable sound of their owners voice. Barking excitedly as they ran toward it, they are believed to have rounded a corner only to discover President Obama giving a speech on the screen of a television in an electronics store. Reports confirmed the pair, having caused quite a commotion, were then chased down the block by the towns dogcatcher, escaping only after Bo bit the man on the seat of his pants, causing him to yelp in pain and exposing his heart-patterned boxer shorts to passersby beneath the flap of torn fabric.  Some days later, Sunny and Bo appeared ready to give up, having convinced themselves they would never again sniff fresh tomatoes from Michelle Obamas vegetable garden or receive one of Treasury Secretary Jack Lews signature belly rubs. Deciding they were simply too tired and demoralized to continue onward, the pair are said to have stopped to sleep for the night in the bed of a beat-up, old pickup truck. Sources said they were jarred awake in the morning when the engine roared to life and the pickup lurched out onto the highway.  After initially panicking when they realized they were being driven to an unknown destination, the two dogs reportedly soon found themselves enjoying the breeze rushing through their fur and the vast stretches of ground they were quickly covering. Several hours later, the dogs are said to have smelled something familiar, perking their heads up over the tailgate and then howling in delight when they saw trees filled with pink cherry blossoms growing denser around them.  Wait a second, I recognize those barks, said President Obama, interrupting his introduction of a judicial nominee at a Rose Garden press conference to discover the dogs bounding across the South Lawn toward him. Quick, get Sasha and Malia! Oh, my goodness! Where on earth have you rascals been?  Everyone get out here! he continued, embracing Sunny and Bo as they eagerly licked his face and the first family came running to welcome them home. Theyre back!  At press time, Michelle Obama was reportedly rolling her eyes and saying I guess everythings back to normal as the family sat down for their first meal together since their reunion and heard the unmistakable sound of Bo lapping water from an East Wing toilet."
13,Fake,"Obama Signs Executive Order Banning The National Anthem At All Sporting Events Nationwide WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP)  Early this morning, President Obama made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency with the signing of Executive Order 14302, which makes it illegal to perform the national anthem at sporting events nationwide. Under the new order, it is now illegal to perform or recite the national anthem in any public venue. Because the anthem is primarily performed before sporting events, this is where the new order will have its biggest impact. Individuals who violate this order can face fines of up to 5,000 dollars and up to one year in federal prison.    The president said that his decision is a show of solidarity with the athletes who have been taking a knee during the anthem to protest police brutality. The President went on to say that the language used in the anthem is violent and hostile to African Americans.  If the recent protests by athletes like San Francisco 49ers Quarterback Colin Kaepernick have taught us anything, its that the anthem is far too violent and far too polarizing to have any place in the national discourse. Our nation is being torn apart by a song, a song that is outdated and, jingoistic. Without swift action, we cannot move forward as a nation; we cannot heal the wounds of racial division. How can we expect our police officers to stop killing African Americans when the very song of our nation is one that glorifies killing?  Obama said that he would consider rescinding the order if Congress can come up with a politically correct version that more accurately reflects our changing values as a nation.  The days of the United States being a domineering world power that seeks to police the entire world through military force are coming to an end, Obama said. We need an anthem that reflects the nation we are becoming, not the nation we used to be.  It has now been over two months since Kaepernick was first spotted sitting down as the national anthem was sung at a preseason NFL game because he refused to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.  In a relatively short period of time, his protest of police brutality and racial injustice in the United States has captivated the country and sparked a debate not only about the state of race relations in America, but about what exactly it means to be a patriot.  Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has already offered her support of President Obamas decree and has vowed to uphold the order if she wins in Novembers general election. She echoed his concerns about the anthems militaristic language and called it one of the last remnants of slavery.    Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump had some harsh words for both President Obama and democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over the new Executive Order.  The hatred that President Obama and crooked Hillary have for this country really knows no bounds, Trump said at a press conference this morning in southern Iowa. I can tell you that when Im elected Ill have them both thrown in jail, and Ill make sure that they have to listen to the anthem in their jail cells all day long. I just hope we can stop them from rigging the election.  Chicago Cubs third baseman Paul Horner said that he will refuse to play until the Presidents order is reversed.  The national anthem is part of the game, Horner told ESPN. He might as well outlaw peanuts and crackerjacks. We always sing the anthem before we play ball, so if they arent going to sing the anthem, Im not going to play ball. I think youre going to find that Im not the only one who feels this way. Ive already got at least ten teammates who are ready to join me in a show of solidarity. I really think we can start a trend here.  The reaction to the new Executive Order has not been all negative, however. Denver Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall, who has himself taken a knee in protest of the National Anthem, called this A great day not just for African Americans, but for all Americans who value freedom. He said that encouraging people to sing a song that contains such blatant nationalism and militarism makes us no better than North Korea, and causes the majority of Americans to behave like a pack of rabid, mind-controlled zombies.  Obama also managed to garner the support of MLB commissioner Rob Manfred.  People like to watch sports because they provide a distraction from their day to day lives. the commissioners office told CNN via e-mail. There no need to taint that with political statements. I applaud the Presidents leadership on this difficult issue.    Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, spoke to CNN about the ban.  This is a story about President Obama banning the National Anthem at sporting events around the country, Bradley said. I just want to say a big thanks to every God-fearing, Patriotic American that has supported our cause that gives brand new socks to the homeless. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps so much.  Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told CNN he disagrees with the President  What the President really needs to do is put a ban on masturbation in this country. It is important to remember that our Lord and Savior loves each and every one of us, unless we masturbate, then well burn in Hell for eternity.  While Executive Order 14302 is likely to be challenged in court, experts say it could be tied up for years, meaning that it is unlikely to be reversed before it takes effect on December 1st. In the meantime, they say to expect numerous protests from those who disagree with the presidents decision.  The Obama Administration has set up a special 24-hour hotline to address any questions and concerns regarding the new Executive Order. The number for the hotline is (785) 273-0325."
14,Fake,"How Obama Used The DOJ To Destroy A Reporters Life And Blanket Full Immunity Over Clinton A quick trip down memory lane causes a stumble over this gem from Obama. He was gearing up for his first run at the office of President and was spewing lies all over the American public.    Ill make our government open and transparent so that anyone can ensure that our business is the peoples business.  He is finally living up to that with less than a month left to his Presidency. He is not bothering to hide the dirty business he conducts, because he just doesnt care anymore. Recent months aside, everything that Obama pledged regarding transparency was smoke and mirrors.  Many are speculating that he will step up and stop talking about the Hillary email scandal and simply pardon her from any prosecution. It is in his best interest to do so. His attempts to marginalize the issue by nitpicking the statutory categories of confidential, secret and top secret by commenting that theres classified and then theres classified were not successful. He then took up the Clinton rhetoric of Russian spies. Since emails from the President to the unsecure Clinton email were found, it is likely that he will try and end the scandal while he still has the power to do so.  A reporter with first-hand knowledge sums up Obamas transparent government, Obama and his team criminalized reporting, becoming the most secretive White House since Richard Nixon.  A message on the White House website from Obama makes it clear he still maintains the illusion that his office upheld the pledge of transparency;  My Administration is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in Government.  We will work together to ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration. Openness will strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness in Government.  Every action taken by Barack Hussein Obama was calculated. He knew, as did his advisors and supporters, that he was actively engaged in deception against the United States. David Axelrod was the Chief Strategist for both of Obamas campaigns. He also served as Senior Adviser to the President until 2011.  He was positioned to not only witness the secrecy that Obama demanded but he was also part of it. After leaving the Obama administration, Axelrod began to hint that things were quite different if we only looked below the surface.  Some of his revelations regarding Obama continue to come as a shock to people who the President painted with the colors of truth.  Obama lied about his support FOR same-sex marriage before announcing his support for it in 2012. Yet if Obamas views were evolving publicly, they were fully evolved behind closed doors, Axelrod writes. The president was champing at the bit to announce his support for the right of gay and lesbian couples to wed. Obama chewed out Maureen Dowd on the campaign plane during the 2008 campaign. No one got under Baracks skin more than Maureen  He was patronizing and disrespectful. This is a direct contradiction to the calm, composed, Obama that Axelrod had helped to portray. He even lashed out at Axelrod. Obama can have a short fuse, though he hides it from the public: The president called Axelrod a motherr and stalked out of a meeting after his strategist criticized the presidents debating techniques as Obama prepared for his 2012 debate with Republican nominee Mitt Romney says Axelrod. While those incidents speak to Obamas two-faced behavior, some of the secrecy of his administration can be summed up as simply lies;  Lie: Obama has told the world there has never been a better friend of Israel in the White House.  Truth: In September 2012, an Israeli newspaper reported that senior Obama Administration officials have told Tehran that Barack Obama does not intend to join Israel in any attack on Irans nuclear installations.  Lie: In May 2011, Obama said the fence between America and Mexico was basically complete.  Truth: The Department of Homeland Security admits just 36.3 miles or 5% of the border is fenced.  Lie: Obama lied and said abortions would not be publicly funded under Obamacare.  Truth: A March 2012 edict from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) unequivocally ruled Obamacare will use our tax dollars to fund abortion.  Ben Rhodes was Obamas partner in crime when it comes to one of the biggest lies of the administration; the Iran nuclear treaty. Rhodes, Obamas Deputy National Security Adviser, openly admitted his contempt for journalists, All these newspapers used to have foreign bureaus. Now they dont. They call us to explain to them whats happening in Moscow and Cairo. Most of the outlets are reporting on world events from Washington. The average reporter we talk to is 27 years old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns. Thats a sea change. They literally know nothing.  He later admitted more to David Samuels, a writer profiling Rhodes for a New York Times Magazine cover story; In the spring of last year, legions of arms-control experts began popping up at think tanks and on social media, and then became key sources for hundreds of often-clueless reporters. We created an echo chamber. They were saying things that validated what we had given them to say. Rhodes was obviously not ashamed to display his contempt.  Fast forward to the present day and the new level of corruption that Obama reached when dealing with journalist James Rosen. In 2006, Risen published State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration. Unsurprisingly, President Bush did not take kindly to the book and his administration turned the whole situation into an investigation of government whistleblowers.  Risen was subpoenaed to reveal his sources, something he vehemently refused to do. He speaks about the attempt by Presidents to try and spin these stories; Well, they have gone after investigative reporting. They try to take, essentially, stories that they dont like, and try to find some classified information that might be part of that, and then turn it into a criminal leak investigation in which they say someone mishandled or disclosed classified information. As you know, you could do that with virtually any story in Washington.  Since then Risen has fought the Bush administration and then the Obama administration. In 2009, Obama took a rather unprecedented step of renewing a subpoena scheduled to expire that year. He was probably hoping nobody remembered that when in 2014 speech he told reporters; Here, in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground.  In 2010, despite Risen keeping his sources confidential, the federal government indicted Jeffrey A. Sterling, a former CIA operative, with leaking the classified information to Risen. He continued his defiance, facing jail time, when the government ordered him to appear as a witness at the trial of Sterling.  Finally in January of 2015, after 7 years of uncertainty, the government decided not to call Risen in the trial. His fight for the truth had finally won.  Risen is a good example of how the Obama administration has fought the very ideas that he promised to uphold. It is very likely that we will see more insiders coming forward to open up about Obamas years in the White House. The truth would be a refreshing change.  A supporter of Risen, Jerry Kammer, a former Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who now works at the Center for Immigration Studies, has this to say about President Obama;  He promised to be a different kind of president. But he has only suppressed efforts to disclose the governments misdeeds. His administration has been untransparent at so many levels."
15,Fake,"REVEALED  Harry Reid Made a HUGE Mistake Right Before Leaving Congress, Its DEVASTATING Once, Harry Reid pushed through the nuclear option to thwart the Republicans from representing their constituents. That very move is now coming back to haunt his Liberals peers just as Reid makes his long overdue exit from Congress.  He was warned that he and his fellow Democrats would one day regret this, but the arrogant Nevada Senators ignored the sound words of advice.That day has now arrived. The nuclear option will allow the Republican-controlled Senate to turn bills into law by a simple majority of 51 votes and not the super majority which requires 60 votes of approval, as Biz Pac Review notes.  Harry Reids nuclear option requiring only 51 votes to pass measures in the Senate coincided with exactly the number of seats Liberals held at the time. Now, the Republicans control both the House and Senate  which will allow them to easily pass all of the items President-Elect Donald Trumps agenda, if the career GOP politicians have the nerve, of course.  Should any GOP Senators jump ship and a rare tie occur in the Senate, Trumps agenda will still survive a nuclear option vote. Vice President-Elect Mike Pence holds the tie-breaking vote!  At least in public, Liberals are not willing to admit they are kicking themselves over following Harry Reids urgings on the nuclear option vote. At the time, Reid claimed the extreme rule change was necessary because the GOP was engaged in unprecedented obstruction.  Apparently saying NO! to  economically unfeasible Obama dictates is obstruction. The Republicans were following the Constitution and doing the job they were elected by We the People to do  which they can now do even more easily thanks to Harry Reid.  If Republicans want to go on record supporting radicals, thats their decision and they will have to live with it, Kristen Orthman, a spokeswoman for Sen. Reid, said. If its radical to put Americans first, than so be it.  Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley claims he has absolutely no regret, over Reids nuclear option. Charles Schumer, the incoming Senate Minority Leader, doesnt appear to have been all that eager to accept the nuclear option.  Schumer reportedly wanted to keep the super majority vote threshold for both cabinet and Supreme Court appointments. Either his peers in the Senate did not share his concerns about the future when Republicans would be back in power, and felt Liberals would always be able to maintain a majority in the Senate, or were just too afraid of Harry Reid to vote against his plan.  One Liberal Senator, Richard Shelby from Alabama, tried to warn his fellow Democrats they were engaging in short term thinking when voting in favor of the nuclear option.

16,Real,"Trump Plans To Dissolve His Foundation; N.Y. Attorney General Pushes Back Updated Dec. 25 at 3:53 pm E.T.  President-elect Donald Trump plans to dissolve his foundation, his transition team announced on in statement on Saturday.  Soon after, though, the New York attorney general's spokesperson tweeted that he legally can't, until the state's investigation of the Trump Foundation is complete.  .@Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump Foundation still under investigation by @AGSchneiderman, cannot legally dissolve until investigation complete Amy Spitalnick (@amyspitalnick) December 24, 2016 Press Secretary Amy Spitalnick was responding to Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold, who asked if the investigation would continue.  In October, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman ordered the foundation to stop raising money in New York, saying the charity was not registered to do so under state law.  In Saturday's statement, Trump is quoted as saying:  ""The Foundation has done enormous good works over the years in contributing millions of dollars to countless worthy groups, including supporting veterans, law enforcement officers and children. However, to avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways."" The announcement comes shortly after a report from The New York Times discussing the president-elect's many potential conflicts of interest. The Times reports that Trump and his family ""are rushing to resolve potential controversies  like shuttering foundations and terminating development deals  even as the president-elect publicly maintains that no legal conflicts exist.""  An NPR report from earlier this year compared the work of the Trump Foundation with that of the Clinton Foundation, which came under fire during the campaign, noting the similarities seem to end with their names. As NPR's Joel Rose reported, ""The Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, as it's formally known, is huge. It has hundreds of employees and a $90 million budget. The Donald J. Trump Foundation, by contrast, is fairly small. It has no full-time employees and a budget of about $600,000.""  In an interview with NPR's Allison Aubrey Sunday, Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold provided context.  ""The Donald J. Trump Foundation has been around since the late '80s, and on paper it sort of looks like what a lot of other rich people have, which is a foundation that's set up to give Trump's money away. But it's actually not that at all  for many of the recent years between 2009 and 2015, it didn't actually get any money from Trump at all  instead he gave away other people's money kind of under his own name, to people that thought they were getting Trump's money. He also used it to apparently violate the law in a number of ways  he used it to buy big portraits of himself including one that hangs on the wall of a sports bar he owns, and he used it to pay off debts or obligations that his businesses have incurred. So he was already under investigation by the New York Attorney General for apparently violating a number of federal laws that govern charities."" David Fahrenthold's reporting in the Post has shown that Trump hasn't given any of his own money to the foundation since 2008. The Post says Vince and Linda McMahon, owners of World Wrestling Entertainment, have been major donors; Trump recently nominated Linda McMahon to head the Small Business Administration."

20,Fake,"Heading out the door, Obama bans offshore drilling in Atlantic, Arctic Oceans Trump might be able to reverse it, but its tricky.  Hes only got a few weeks left to damage Americas energy independence. Obama needs to work fast, and he is. Ever the creative one, Obama has found a way to twist the original intent of a law passed in 1953 to enact bans on offshore drilling in massive sections of the Atlantic and Arctic oceans. The law was never intended to facilitate any such action, as The Hill explains, but since when does Obama consider himself constrained by the law?  Obama will use a section of the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to implement the protections, Bloomberg and The New York Times reported, citing sources familiar with the plans.  Its unclear, however, how large Obamas protected areas will be.  The action would answer calls from environmentalists to implement so-called 12(a) protections in the Atlantic and Arctic as a more lasting legacy against fossil fuels from Obama.  Obama last month made final a plan for offshore drilling lease sales from 2017 to 2022 that excludes the Atlantic and Arctic.  But that plans time period is limited, and President-elect Donald Trump can revise the plan to insert lease sales if he wishes.  Previous presidents have used the 1953 law rarely. In each case, they focused on small areas of water and set time limits in an effort to protect particular species.  Its unclear how easily Trump can undo the protections, since no previous president has tried to roll back a predecessors actions under that law. Congress may also step in to undo Obamas actions.  This is a classic act of recklessness on Obamas part  applying a law beyond all recognition of its original intent, and telling American oil companies they cant explore gigantic portions of the world. Just because hes Barack Obama and he hates fossil fuels. He also leave a mess for Donald Trump to try to clean up, if he can.  Can he?  Maybe. The most effective way for Trump to reverse Obamas heading-out-the-door finger in the eye to Americas oil industry, if not necessarily the simplest, would be to ask Congress to make an amendment to the law, essentially nullifying Obamas actions. He could also amend Obamas drilling lease plan for the period of 2017-2022 by adding more leases, conceivably in the areas of the Atlantic and Arctic where Obama is trying to ban them.  What Trump might try to do instead is simply declare that Obamas action under the law is null and void at the executive level, and substitute his own. Its not clear how much force of law Obamas action has, although its not purely an executive order because he did take the action under an existing statute  albeit very far afield from the original intent of the statute.  I suspect that if Trump simply tries to reverse Obamas actions unilaterally, there will be political resistance but no real constituency with an avenue to effectively prevent Trumps action.  There is some luxury of time here, because at the moment most American oil companies who engage in offshore drilling do so almost exclusively in the Gulf of Mexico. Offshore drilling in the Pacific has also been made very difficult by political resistance, and that could also be a challenge for Trumps new EPA.  In the meantime, Obama shows us once again that his priority above all else is the service of a left-wing ideological agenda. If he wanted to enact this ban at any point during his presidency, he could have done so and dealt with the political blowback. Instead, he waited until the final weeks of his presidency so he could lay this trap for his successor, and for the nation, to deal with.  As relieved as we are that we will never have to talk about President Hillary, the end of President Obama cant come soon enough either."

Trump has pledged to increase the size of the nation's armed forces.  Viola, founder and chairman of Virtu Financial and owner of pro hockey's Florida Panthers, said in a statement that, if confirmed by the Senate, ""I will work tirelessly to provide our President with the land force he will need to accomplish any mission in support of his National Defense Strategy.""  His primary focus, Viola said, ""will be ensuring that Americas soldiers have the ways and means to fight and win across the full spectrum of conflict.""

22,Satire,"OBAMA POLITELY ASKS TRUMP TO WAIT UNTIL INAUGURATION BEFORE DESTROYING WORLD WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)In an Oval Office meeting that White House aides described as friendly but strained, President Obama politely asked President-elect Donald Trump to wait until he is officially sworn in to begin destroying the world.  According to the aides, Obama said that, while he understood that Trump was eager to create potentially cataclysmic diplomatic crises around the world, tradition dictated that he wait until he is actually President to do so.  Obama cited the example of George W. Bush, who waited until he took the oath of office before wreaking destruction on a massive scale.  Therell be loads of time for you to do stuff like that, Obama reportedly said.

24,Real,"Obama ""permanently"" bans drilling in parts of Arctic, Atlantic HONOLULU -- President Barack Obama on Tuesday designated the bulk of U.S.-owned waters in the Arctic Ocean and certain areas in the Atlantic Ocean as indefinitely off limits to future oil and gas leasing.  The move helps put some finishing touches on Mr. Obamas environmental legacy while also testing President-elect Donald Trumps promise to unleash the nations untapped energy reserves.  The White House announced the actions in conjunction with the government of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, which also placed a moratorium on new oil and gas leasing in its Arctic waters, subject to periodic review.  Mr. Obama is making use of an arcane provision in a 1953 law to ban offshore leases in the waters permanently. The statute says that the president of the United States may, from time to time, withdraw from disposition any of the unleased lands of the outer Continental Shelf.  Environmental groups hope the ban, despite relying on executive powers, will be difficult for future presidents to reverse. The White House said its confident the presidents order will withstand legal challenge and said the language of the statute provides no authority for subsequent presidents to undo permanent withdrawals.  The Atlantic waters placed off limits to new oil and gas leasing are 31 canyons stretching off the coast of New England south to Virginia, though some had hoped for a more extensive ban that would have extended further south.  Existing leases arent affected by the presidents executive actions.  The administration cited environmental concerns in both regions to justify the moratorium. Mr. Obama also cited the importance of the Chukchi and Beaufort seas in providing subsistence for native Alaskans and the vulnerability of the ecosystem to an oil spill to justify his directive.  Mr. Obama also noted the level of fuel production occurring in the Arctic. Mr. Obama said just 0.1 percent of offshore crude production came from the Arctic in 2015, and at current oil prices, significant production would not occur in future decades.  Thats why looking forward, we must continue to focus on economic empowerment for Arctic communities beyond this one sector, Mr. Obama said.  Still, industry officials objected to Mr. Obamas memorandum, calling it last minute political rhetoric.  Instead of building on our nations position as a global energy leader, todays unilateral mandate could put America back on a path of energy dependence for decades to come, said Dan Naatz of the Independent Petroleum Association of America.  And Alaska Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, said Mr. Obamas move marginalized local voices. He said no one is more invested than Alaskans in making sure Arctic habitats are protected.  To lock it up against any further exploration or development activity is akin to saying that the voices of activists who live in Lower 48 cities have a greater stake than those to whom the Arctic is our front yard and our back yard, he said in a statement.  In issuing a permanent ban, Mr. Obama appears to be trying to tie the hands of his successor. Mr. Trump has vowed a domestic energy revolution and is filling his Cabinet with nominees deeply opposed to Mr. Obamas environmental and climate change actions.  Environmental groups were calling for a permanent ban even before the presidential election, but Mr. Trumps victory has provided greater urgency for them and for businesses that rely on tourism and fishing. Mr. Trump has said he intends to use all available fuel reserves for energy self-sufficiency - and that its time to open up offshore drilling.  This decision will help protect existing lucrative coastal tourism and fishing businesses from offshore drilling, which promises smaller, short-lived returns and threatens coastal livelihoods, said Jacqueline Savitz, a senior vice president at the advocacy group, Oceana.  A key question to be answered is how difficult it will be for future presidents to overturn Mr. Obamas decision should they seek to do so.  The American Petroleum Institute pointed to 2008 when President George W. Bush used a simple memorandum to remove previously withdrawn lands and make all Outer Continental Shelf lands available for leasing except marine sanctuaries.  Fortunately, there is no such thing as a permanent ban, said the institutes Erik Milito.  But White House officials in a conference call with reporters said previous indefinite withdrawals remain in place and voiced confidence that Mr. Obamas decision will stand.  Advocacy groups were already warning that they were prepared to file suit to protect the ban during future administrations.  If Donald Trump tries to reverse President Obamas withdrawals, he will find himself in court, said Marissa Knodel of Friends of the Earth.  Frank Knapp, president of the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce in Columbia, said he was extremely disappointed in the decision not to extend drilling protections to the entire Atlantic seaboard.  Knapp and his group were among a number of business groups in the southeast who had advocated for banning new drilling leases off their shores, arguing that the environmental impacts would hurt fishing, tourism and other businesses the region relies upon. Hed gone to Washington to meet with Obama administration officials, and believed the entire Atlantic was to be protected.  The decision came as Mr. Obama spends the holidays in Hawaii. Some Democratic lawmakers applauded Obama, while some Republicans were highly critical.  As President-elect Trump nominates fossil fuel allies to his Cabinet, President Obama has instead put the interests of millions of Americans ahead of those of Big Oil with these permanent protections, said Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts.  The extremes to which this president will go to appease special interests never ceases to amaze, countered Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, and chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources. This is not a moral calling; its an abuse of power."
25,Satire,"Supremacy Now! Things White People Do Well In light of the fact that a huge swath of white nationalists and separatists in the U.S.  from the hoary old KKK to neo-Confederates to garden-variety racists and assorted Bannonistas  are positively giddy at the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency, perhaps its time to take stock of what it is, exactly, that whites do so well.  After all, tens of millions of Americans enthusiastically voted for a thin-skinned semi-literate, serial bankrupt and congenital groper who made a point of courting bigots and sectarians during his campaign. The least the rest of us can do is examine why so many white Americans remain so sure of their own racial supremacy, and why theyve embraced a character like Donald Trump as their knight in orange armor.  With that in mind, here in no particular order are a few things at which whites historically and unquestionably excel.  Killing Other White People  Contrary to Mr. Trumps puzzling insistence that 80 percent of whites killed in America are murdered by African Americans, pesky FBI statistics indicate that more than 80 percent of murdered white Americans are, in fact, killed by other whites. (Blacks accounted for less than 15 percent of white deaths in 2014, and a devastating 90 percent of black deaths. Neither of those statistics is anything to celebrate  but nor are they suggestive of the epidemic of black-on-white violence that Trump and other fact-averse racialists continue to bleat and tweet about.)  Walking on the Moon  To date, only 12 humans have walked on the moon. They were all white guys. Why do other races hate the moon so much? Why?  Avoiding Arrest for Illicit Drug Use  According to a survey conducted a few years ago by the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, almost 20 percent of whites have used cocaine. For Latinos and blacks, that number is closer to 10 percent. White people have also used or abused prescription pain killers (Oxy, for example), hallucinogens, and stimulants like crystal meth at higher percentage rates than most other ethnic groups.  Despite these shenanigans, blacks are arrested for drug possession more than three times as often as whites  a discrepancy that might be due to racial bias, more aggressive policing in minority neighborhoods, or other law-enforcement vagaries. But isnt it just possible that the lower arrest rate for whites is due to the fact that some people are really good at getting away with enjoying illegal drugs, without attracting the attention of the po-po? How about some credit where credit is due?  Eating Competitively  A weirdly high percentage of the highest ranked competitive eaters in the world  men and women, alike  are white. This is exactly the sort of accomplishment that billions of people in the non-white world look upon with astonishment, and envy. And empty bellies. And disgust. But mostly envy.  Drinking Donkey Semen  Remember seeing those adorable Florida twins, Brynne and Claire Odioso, downing mugs of donkey semen and urine on an episode of Fear Factor a few years back? Yeah, neither do I, because the network decided not to air the footage. (NBC: Global arbiter of good taste!)  But the adorable Odiosos had a good time chatting about their experience after the fact  and who among us has not seen clips of other stomach-churning acts from the shows long, dignified run? Sure, there were some non-white contestants on Fear Factor, but evidently none had the heart or the class to chug donkey spunk in order to be on TV.  Saluting Like Nazis  As a recent alt-right conference in Washington, DC, makes plain, white people are still simply the best at giving Nazi-style salutes while hollering original slogans like, Hail Trump! Hail our people!  Now, by our people, the uber-homogeneous conference crowd might have been referring to the marvelously diverse, pluralistic society weve built here in America over centuries. But seeing as how keynote speaker and alt-right Grand Poobah Richard B. Spencer assured his audience that white people must conquer or die and that America belongs to us, the attendees probably did mean hail whites! after all. Which makes those straight-arm salutes that much more  Nuremberg-y.  Keeping Non-Whites From Voting  Give it up for the bright, white GOP: when it wants to make voting more difficult, instead of more accessible, for millions of Americans, todays Republicans know how to get all their cute little voter-suppression ducks in a row. In fact, this years presidential election was the first in 50 years in which full protections of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act were not enforced across the land. Talk about supremacy!  Being Hannity  As earnestly as people of color might yearn to be Bill OReillys angry, insecure niece, that role is now, and always will be, filled to perfection by Sean Hannity. Sorry, folks.  Again, these are but a few of the endeavors and pursuits at which whites excel. Any sentient human could come up with countless more. Hail our people, indeed."
26,Satire,"ExxonMobil CEO Relieved It Finally Too Late To Do Anything About Climate Change Tillerson says things could have gone really bad for him if people had followed through on their vows to stop climate change. IRVING, TXSaying the multinational oil and gas conglomerate had really dodged a bullet, ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson told reporters Wednesday how relieved he was now that it was finally too late to do anything about climate change.  The 64-year-old petroleum executive, who acknowledged that throughout his career he had feared the public might take action to curb rising temperatures by imposing emissions restrictions or mandating a switch to alternative energy, said he was just happy that the window for avoiding the planets environmental destruction had closed, and that the entire industry was now free to carry on as usual.  I was really worried for a while there that some kind of law would be passed to stop us from releasing all those hydrocarbons into the atmosphere, but I guess not, said Tillerson, describing how he felt as if a tremendous weight had been lifted from his shoulders now that catastrophic climate change was an inescapable certainty. Seriously, its a huge load off. There were a number of real tense years after the recycling movement picked up momentum when we thought people might all turn away from fossil fuels next. But its just so reassuring to know that we passed the point where its no longer possible to stop global warming through environmental regulation or green energy or anything like that.  Now I can finally just relax, he continued. This really makes things so much easier.  The CEO remarked that, back when it was still possible to halt the devastating effects of climate change, he constantly feared that the energy industry would be forced to make costly concessions toward sustainability, perhaps investing in expensive technology that would reduce oil and gas companies environmental impact, and thereby severely harm his corporations bottom line.  Tillerson told reporters that growing public interest in wind and solar energy gave him a pretty good scare for a while, but noted how he eventually came to realize the publics engagement was largely limited to vocalizing support for the initiatives rather than taking any substantive action to move the overall energy sector in those directions. He also admitted to losing sleep in 2009 when Congress considered regulating carbon emissions with a cap-and-trade system, although he said he now felt silly for ever believing that might actually happen.  While he became less worried about the possibility of government regulation after seeing the rapid melting of polar ice caps go completely unchecked, Tillerson stated that he was careful not to get his hopes up too high until humanity had blown through every last milestone for averting the worst effects of global warming, including atmospheric carbon dioxide surpassing 400 parts per million and average worldwide temperatures exceeding 1 degree Celsius above preindustrial levels.  After scientists started saying we were in the middle of a global mass extinction event and still nobody at any level did anything to try to stop itthats when I knew we were in the clear, said Tillerson, remarking that, by that point, he had become certain everyone would just keep driving their gas-powered vehicles and running their air conditioners 24 hours a day no matter what. Theres just no way people are going to start switching over to renewables at this point. Hell, even if the whole world demanded new fuel-efficiency standards today, theyd be completely useless now that were beyond the point of no return, so really, why even bother?  And thank goodness, he added. Everyones complete hopelessness about the whole situation really is the best thing that could have happened to us."

28,Real,"Trumps vow to undo Obama rules? Not so fast WASHINGTON  President-elect Donald Trump campaigned on a vow to repeal what he claims are job-killing federal regulations, including rules limiting power plant emissions, protecting rivers and streams, and preventing banks from reckless lending.  Easier said than done.  The same deliberate process used to enact the Clean Power Plant rule, the waters of the U.S. Clean Water Rule, or regulations under the Dodd-Frank law designed to clamp down on Wall Street usually requires the same long slog to undo them, making quick repeal unattainable.  In general, rule changes originate from the agencies who must offer a legal, scientific or other legitimate reason in defense of the proposed change, and solicit public comments first before a new rule or its repeal can take effect. In most cases, the final rule may not become effective until at least 30 days after its publication in the Federal Register.  The process is laborious, but that shouldnt stop every agency head from setting it in motion, Andy Koenig, vice president of policy at the Koch-affiliated Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, wrote in a recent column on the groups website. The very fact that it is so time-consuming makes it essential for agencies to start the process immediately.  Republicans seek quick repeal of latest Obama administration regulations Small businesses can expect policy changes under Trump But a Republican president and a compliant Congress controlled by Republicans can still do quite a bit in short order to block a host of proposed regulations or reverse rules that were recently implemented. Overall, critics say regulations pose a $4 trillion drag  on to the U.S. economy every year, according to some estimates, though agencies also design rules to maximize economic benefits.  Stakeholders have been weighing in about the rules they'd like to see tossed.  Among them is the House Freedom Caucus, the hard right faction of House lawmakers who have clashed with congressional leaders in recent years. The group Wednesday asked the incoming Trump administration to jettison 227 rules its members view as burdensome, costly or unworkable, including ones setting nutrition standards for school lunches, requiring certain animal and plant inspections, and development of alternative fuels.  Despite some steep hurdles, heres what Trump and Congress can do:  Incoming presidents can prevent regulations that have yet to be finalized from ever taking effect.  Its standard practice for a new administration to freeze any regulations that are in the pipeline until the incoming regime can review them, said Jerry Ellig, senior research fellow at George Mason Universitys Mercatus Center.  President Obama did just than when he came into office in 2009, as did his predecessors.  If its something that the current administration has finished and sent to the Federal Register but it isnt published before Inauguration Day, then its easy for a new administration to pull those rules back, he said.  Many could still go forward after the review is complete and the Trump administration supports them.  Congress also has a limited window where it can undo rules with a simple majority vote that cannot be filibustered.  Such resolutions of disapproval must be passed and signed within 60 legislative days from their publication in the federal register and their insertion into the Congressional Record.  Under the Congressional Review Act, agencies must report on their rulemaking activities to Congress and provide lawmakers a legislative roadmap to overturn those rules if they oppose them, according to the Congressional Research Service.  The Mercatus Center lists 172 Obama administration rules adopted since June 9 that could be subject to the review act. They include rules on implementing school wellness policies, regulating municipal solid waste landfills and food labeling guidelines.  But the incoming Congress will have to be picky because the law requires that rule reversals can only be done one at a time. With all the other priorities facing them such as working on a budget and considering Trumps nominees, theres may not be much floor time for wholesale regulatory rollback, Ellig said.  That hurdle helps explain why the Congressional Review Act has been used only once since it became law 20 years ago. In 2001, Congress and the George W. Bush administration overturned a Clinton administration rule setting an ergonomics standard for the workplace.  Agencies can decide not to enforce certain regulations because theyre focused on other priorities. Or the Trump administration could choose to stop defending rules if they are the subject of a court challenge.  That passive approach is a pretty easy way to undermine laws that are already around and public protections that already exist, said Lisa Gilbert, director of Public Citizens Congress Watch, a government watchdog group.  Deciding not to defend the regulation in court wouldnt guarantee the rules demise.  Affected third parties would likely still be arguing for its enforcement and judges could still rule on the legality of the provision. But it could leave open questions that we would obviously rather have answered about our regulatory state, Gilbert said.  Lawmakers could pass a law undoing the rule.  The cleanest  and in many ways steepest  path to eliminating a rule is to have Congress approve legislation doing just that.  Thats what it will probably take to gut some of the Obama administrations most high-profile regulations, such as ones associated with clean water, clean power, overtime protections, the Affordable Care Act and Wall Street reform.

(Photo: Paul Sancya, AP) Within that category, there are several approaches: using spending bills to insert language known as riders preventing an agency from allocating funds to enforce a regulation, using a process known as reconciliation to fast-track bills to undo rules, and passing bills through the regular legislative process.  That last option is least desirable for regulatory reformers because it could take years, and it gives Democrats the chance to stop a rule rollback through filibuster.  None of this includes the executive orders that President Trump could undo with a stroke of his pen, namely President Obama's deportation protections for millions of undocumented immigrants who arrived here as young children.  Trump has already unveiled his plan to tackle regulation reform: Ask all department heads to submit a list of every wasteful and unnecessary regulation which kills jobs, and which does not improve public safety, and eliminate them.  Gilbert, with Public Citizen, said its hard to predict how many of the Obama-era rules will survive.  Our success in (preserving) any of them is going to depend on our ability to make it very clear to the American public ... what it means to take away these things that are so populist, so important, she said. Nobody wants to lose pay raises theyve already achieved or protections of their health and their air."
29,Satire,"TRUMP WARNS HILLARY MAY RIG ELECTION BY GETTING MORE VOTES GREENSBORO, N.C. (The Borowitz Report)Hillary Clinton is plotting to rig the election by getting more votes than I do, Donald J. Trump warned his supporters on Friday.  Speaking at a rally, Trump detailed what he called Clintons vast conspiracy to accrue more votes than he does on Election Day.  The media wont tell you this, but Crooked Hillary is going around the country every single day, trying to get more votes than I do, he said. Thats how shes going to rig it, folks.  He called the current sexual-assault allegations against him a plot by the Clintons to draw attention away from Hillarys evil plot to get votes.  Is it just a coincidence that these accusations come up at the same time that Crooked Hillary is trying to rig the election by getting votes? he said. The way things are going, I would not be surprised at all if, on Election Day, she has many, many more votes than I do.  Theres something going on, folks, he added.  But, in a sign that Trump does not intend to take Clintons scheme to get more votes lying down, he ended his remarks with an ominous threat. If, on Election Day, Hillary Clinton has more votes than I do, I will sue everyone who voted for her, he said."

The attention-grabbing invitation, which was widely seen as retaliation for the Trump campaigns decision to invite President Obamas estranged half brother, Malik, to the televised forum, sparked howls of protest from Republicans, who charged that Clinton was trying to gain an unfair advantage in the contest.  But Clintons campaign chairman, John Podesta, defended the controversial invitation. If theyre going to have Malik at the debate, then were going to have Donald Trump, he said. Two can play this game.  Appearing on CNN, Trumps campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, blasted the Clinton campaigns invitation of Trump as a blatant ploy to rig the debate.  I know Hillary Clinton wants to try every trick in the book to win this debate, but inviting Donald Trump is really beyond the pale, she said. She should be ashamed of herself."
31,Satire,"Liberals unveil new rock-paper-scissors protocols to determine immigrants futures OTTAWA  At a press conference on Thursday the federal government announced that they would replace the outmoded first-come first-serve immigration application process with a global  rock-paper-scissors competition.  Rock-paper-scissors is a zero-sum hand game that can engage infinite players, explained Immigration Minister John McCallum. Players compete by simultaneously making one of three shapes with their fingers and outstretched hands. The game is regarded as one of the fairest and most respected selection processes in Western society.  This government is simply taking a much-needed common sense approach, stated McCallum. Canadians tell us they want a process that is fairer for people sponsoring family members, a process that is good enough to end bar disputes over the last pint of a pitcher, a process worthy of determining high stakes life changing decisions such as who has to get up and go to the kitchen for more chips during a Netflix binge.  Minister McCallum stated that the government plans to train hundreds of immigration officers to referee rock-paper-scissors. To address concerns over transparency, the process will be televised on TSN.  Ayaan Mashallah, who hopes to compete to bring his parents to Canada, stated: Where Im from our government determines access to social benefits with a nation-wide game of tic-tac-toe, but I will happily respect Canadas unique customs.  The government is expected to unveil further modernization efforts in the administration of public services, including drawing straws for access to Employment Insurance, bingo tournaments for transfer payments to Indigenous peoples, and Russian roulette for child care benefits."
32,Fake,"1 Thing Now Costing Hillary Everything, And The Best Part? She Designed It HERSELF The Democrats thought they had the election in the bag. CNN, ABC, MSNBC, NYT, Huffington Post, and a whole host of other news stations were calling a big Trump loss from day one.  They had to eat their words when the American People showed up on November 8th to prove them dead wrong.  But What Happened Hillary? We are all familiar with the countless leaks that performed catastrophic damage against the Democratic Party. But, in reality, all it did was show the lies, deceit, and corruption already taking place. Nothing that we saw is new, and it should be a bold wake-up call to anyone who believes what our government tells us without thought or question.  The #1 Reason For The Democrats Historic Loss When the dust settled, however, it was clear that the Democratic Party created a wave they never saw coming; they never expected the American People to rise up by the thousands to declare their disgust for the Washington status quo.  How did they create this wave? Their initial strategy elevated Trump. They intended to use Trump as a Pied Piper candidate they would use to portray the Republican Party in a bad light. Their failed strategy was revealed in WikiLeak 1120.    Great job Hillary! Your attempt to put Conservatives in a bad light ended up backfiring big time. You didnt get to steal the Election. No, instead you awakened the ever-awake silent majority waiting to take back this great land.  So, thanks Hillary for being so, so pretentious and ignorant. Your historic loss will ring forever in American History as future generations will come to know you as one of the most corrupt and deceitful politicians ever."
33,Real,"Will Trump's plan mean faster rate hikes? The Federal Reserve is virtually certain to raise interest rates this week for the first time this year, but the course of future hikes has suddenly become cloudier.  The Fed has signaled for many weeks that it plans to hoist its key rate by a quarter percentage point at a two-day meeting that begins Tuesday, and futures markets say theres a 93% chance it will follow through.  Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trumps fiscal stimulus proposals may ultimately require faster rate increases to head off inflation, while other byproducts of his plan could slow the economy and prompt the Fed to act more cautiously.  For now, economists dont expect Fed policymakers to weigh such hypotheticals as they draft their quarterly projections for rate increases over the next few years. Even so, with unemployment falling rapidly and inflation finally picking up, Fed officials likely are no longer inclined to call for slower rate hikes over the long-term, as they have in each of their previous forecasts this year amid headwinds such as weak productivity growth, economists say.   Unemployment is falling toward levels that are arguably below stable inflation, says Tim Duy, a University of Oregon economics professor and author of the Fedwatch blog.  Yet he says the Fed will almost certainly reiterate that rate increases will be gradual.  In November, the jobless rate dropped to 4.6% from 4.9% the previous month. Thats already below the 4.8% that the Fed has deemed the lowest average rate sustainable without generating excessive inflation, or rapid price increases that decrease consumers' purchasing power and especially hurt savers and those on fixed incomes. Low unemployment typically pushes up wages as employers compete for fewer available workers, and price increases typically follow as the firms scramble to maintain profit margins.  That doesnt mean persistently low inflation is poised to suddenly spike.While an inflation measure closely monitored by the Fed rose from 1.2% to 1.4% annually in October as the effects of low gasoline prices faded, thats well below the Feds 2% target.  Still, it was the fastest pace in two years. And annual wage growth hit a seven-year high in October and has climbed steadily since early 2015 in a further signal that inflation is firming, Barclays economist Michael Gapen wrote in a note to clients.  In September, Fed Chair Janet Yellen noted that discouraged workers on the sidelines were streaming back into the labor force, keeping the unemployment rate elevated and providing the economy more room to run without stoking inflation. But the labor force shrank in both October and November, giving the Fed another reason to make a move this week and stick with its previous forecast of two rate hikes next year and three in 2018.  If you were to wait any longer, you would risk getting behind the curve, says JPMorgan Chase economist Michael Feroli. The Fed held off on rate increases earlier this year in response to Chinas slowdown and a sluggish U.S. economy, among other factors.  The future roadmap is fuzzier. Trump has proposed a $1 trillion plan to upgrade the nations infrastructure and sharp tax cuts, a stimulus package that, if passed by Congress, could fuel inflation and force the Fed to lift rates more rapidly.  But, Its probably too early for the Fed to incorporate any fiscal policy issues into their forecast, Duy says. Its similarly too soon, he says, to anticipate  negative economic fallout from Trumps restrictive trade proposals.  On the other hand, the prospect of more federal spending and faster economic growth and inflation under Trump already has strengthened the dollar and pushed up long-term interest rates. Those developments tend to crimp the economy by hurting U.S. exports and discouraging consumer and business borrowing.  If they were to persist or intensify next year, the Fed may raise rates more gradually than anticipated, especially if the faster growth portended by Trumps plan hasnt yet materialized, Feroli says."

35,Fake,"Moments After Being Briefed on Berlin Attack, Obama Hops on Golf Cart President Obama headed to a golf course moments after receiving reports that a truck had plowed through a Christmas market in Berlin in a potential terrorist attack, according to White House pool reports.  Obama, who is vacationing in Hawaii for the holidays, was also briefed by his national security team on the assassination of Russias ambassador to Turkey just before departing for the Mid-Pacific Country Club.  White House press liaison Eric Schultz wrote in a memo that Obama left his rental vacation home at 10:21 a.m. HST, or 3:21 p.m. EST, after a press van held at the house for 11 minutes awaiting the president.  Spectators on the street threw shakas and recorded photos or video on cell phones as the motorcade made the 10-minute drive to Mid-Pacific Country Club, where the president will be golfing under cloudy skies, Schultz wrote, according to Mediate.  Nine people were killed and at least 50 others were injured in the Berlin truck attack. Police believe the incident was deliberate.  Russia, meanwhile, declared the killing of Ambassador Andrey Karlov in Ankara an act of terrorism.  The president has faced scrutiny for his decisions to golf during crises.  In August, the former FEMA Director Michael Brown, who oversaw the federal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, condemned Obama for continuing to golf during his two-week vacation on Marthas Vineyard while historic floods were devastating parts of Louisiana."
36,Real,"Rex Tillerson: an appointment that would confirm Putin's US election win If Rex Tillerson is nominated as the next secretary of state, it would confirm Vladimir Putin as one of the strategic victors of the US presidential election.  Barack Obama has ordered an inquiry into covert Russian intervention in the campaign, which the CIA says was designed to secure a victory for Donald Trump. But whether or not Russian intervention made a significant difference to the outcome, a Tillerson appointment would represent a significant gain for Moscow.  While the other leading candidates for the job hold largely traditional and adversarial views on Russia, the outgoing chief executive of Exxon Mobil has a history of close business ties to Putin, who bestowed the Order of Friendship on Tillerson in 2013.  The Wall Street Journal reported: Friends and associates said few US citizens are closer to Mr Putin than Mr Tillerson.  The 64-year-old Texas oilman spent much of his career working on Russian deals, including a 2011 agreement giving Exxon Mobil access to the huge resources under the Russian Arctic in return for giving the giant state-owned Russian oil company, OAO Rosneft, the opportunity to invest in Exxon Mobils operations overseas.  Tillerson is also friends with the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, a former interpreter who worked as chief of staff for Putin when he was deputy mayor in St Petersburg in the mid-1990s. Sechin, sometimes described as the second-most-powerful man in Russia, is now under US sanctions. He has said that one of his ambitions is to ride the roads in the United States on motorcycles with Tillerson.  The 2011 Exxon-Rosneft agreement was frozen when sanctions were imposed on Russia in 2014, following the annexation of Crimea and covert military intervention in eastern Ukraine. Exxon Mobil estimated the sanctions cost it $1bn and Tillerson has argued strenuously for the measures to be lifted.  Trumps choice suggests he wants to make good on his promise to cut deals with Russia instead of containing it Thomas Wright, Brookings Institution We always encourage the people who are making those decisions to consider the very broad collateral damage of who are they really harming with sanctions, he said, at a shareholders meeting.  In June, two years after sanctions were imposed and in an apparent show of support for Sechin, Tillerson reportedly turned up at a St Petersburg economic summit.  If the sanctions were lifted, the Arctic project would probably go ahead and Tillersons retirement fund of Exxon Mobil stock would increase in value. He would most likely have to divest himself of stock by the time he entered the office on the seventh floor of the state department. It might be harder to divorce his judgments entirely from the oil company where he spent his career.  Trumps choice of Rex Tillerson suggests he wants to make good on his promise to cut deals with Russia instead of containing it, said Thomas Wright, who has written extensively on Trumps foreign policy at the Brookings Institution.   Tillerson has a relationship with Putin and he opposed the sanctions imposed on Russia after the annexation of Crimea. This will alarm those worried about Russian intentions in Europe.  Praising Tillerson in an interview with Fox News Sunday, Trump said: To me a great advantage is that he knows many of the players in the world and he knows them well.  Lest there be any doubt about which players the president-elect had in mind, Trump added: He does massive deals in Russia not for himself, but for the company.  A culture of intimidation Stacks and burn-off from the Exxon Mobil refinery, at dusk in St Bernard Parish, Louisiana. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stacks and burn-off from the Exxon Mobil refinery, at dusk in St Bernard Parish, Louisiana. Photograph: Gerald Herbert/AP In a very real sense, Tillerson has been a head of a state within a state. Exxon Mobil is bigger economically than many countries. It has its own foreign policy and its own contracted security forces.  As a state, it has much in common with the one run by Putin and Sechin.  Reporting on Exxon was not only harder than reporting on the Bin Ladens, it was harder than reporting on the CIA by an order of magnitude, said Steve Coll, who wrote about the company in a book, Private Empire.  They have a culture of intimidation that they bring to bear in their external relations, and it is plenty understood inside the corporation too. They make people nervous, they make people afraid, Coll, now a journalism professor at Columbia University, told Texas Monthly.  Running the state department would not be like running Exxon Mobil, however. For a start, Tillerson would have to audition in front of a sceptical Senate. On Saturday, leading Democrats were painting him as a Moscow stooge.  The New Jersey senator Bob Menendez said on Twitter: Rex Tillerson as secretary of state would guarantee Russia has a willing accomplice in the presidents cabinet.  With a slim 52-48 majority, it would only take three Republican senators in revolt to cast Tillersons job in doubt. He would face aggressive questioning from Republican foreign policy hawks, led by John McCain.  I have obviously concerns about his relationship with Vladimir Putin, who is a thug and a murderer, but obviously we will have hearings on that issue and other issues concerning him will be examined and then its the time to make up your mind on whether to vote yes or no, the Arizona senator told CNN on Saturday.  A US foreign policy based on realpolitik rather than on values would be a disaster for Russia Andrei Kozyrev, former Russian foreign minister McCains former chief of staff, Mark Salter, was far more blunt on Twitter. Tillerson would sell out Nato for Sakhalin oil and his pal, Vlad, he wrote. Should be a rough confirmation hearing, and a no vote on the Senate floor.  Even if Tillerson were to be confirmed, he would not take over the state department with a free hand to rewrite policy. He would face a striking culture clash with the institution, the bastion of foreign policy orthodoxy, which would have an ally in the secretary of defence nominee, retired general James Mattis, who is likely to oppose any erosion of Nato solidarity in the face of Moscows assertiveness in Europe.  Nevertheless, Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Endowment Moscow Center, argued: Tillerson as secretary of state would signify the greatest discontinuity in US foreign policy since the end of the cold war.  Not just in US-Russian relations: a Trump-Tillerson foreign policy would be squarely focused on US national interests, rather than on its global pretensions or any ideology.  Trenin added: It would be hard-nosed and no-nonsense, not averse to the use of force, but in response to a real rather than imaginary threat. In one word: realist.  That is a change that would be undoubtedly be welcomed by Putin, whose vision of foreign policy centres on spheres of interest controlled by global powers, run by strongmen like himself.  Andrei Kozyrev, a former Russian foreign minister, argued that the Kremlin should be careful what it wishes for.  The paradoxical situation now is that Russia is hoping for a US foreign policy based on realpolitik rather than on values, but that would be a disaster for Russia, said Kozyrev, who is now at the Wilson Center thinktank in Washington.  Why? Because the only interest America has in ending the conflicts in eastern Ukraine  or in Syria is actually in American values  that America should be concerned and do everything to alleviate the humanitarian situation and they should help nations to find their path to democracy.  The realpolitik situation is that Russia is stuck in both military conflicts. If you look at this with a cold eye, you say: Let them go on and let them enjoy the disaster they have in eastern Ukraine, Kozyrev said.  Look at Syria. By realpolitik the Americans would rather sit and wait while Russia draws on its resources and gets into bloody conflict."
37,Real,"Feds: Pension Exec Moved $2B for Coke, Hookers, Other Bribes A former top official at the country's third-largest pension fund and two broker-dealers were charged Wednesday in what a federal prosecutor described as a classic bribery scheme that steered $2 billion in trades in exchange for drugs, prostitutes, vacations and U.S. Open tennis tickets.  ""The hard-earned pension savings of New Yorkers should never serve as a vehicle for corrupt, personal enrichment,"" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement, calling the alleged pay-for-play arrangement a ""classic, quid-pro-quo bribery scheme.""  Navnoor Kang, the ex-head of the $184 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund's fixed income trades, received more than $100,000 worth of bribes in the form of trips, gifts, luxury hotel stays and other payoffs from broker-dealers Deborah Kelley and Gregg Schonhorn, prosecutors said.  Kang, 38, was arrested in Portland, Oregon, on securities fraud, honest service wire fraud, conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges.  His attorney, Lauren DeSantis-Then, said her client denies all the charges.  ""Mr. Kang is not guilty and we look forward to our day in court,"" she said.  Kelley, 58, of Piedmont, California, was expected to surrender, authorities said. Her attorney didn't immediately return a request for comment.  Schonhorn, 45, of Short Hills, New Jersey, has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with federal authorities, court papers show. His lawyer didn't immediately return a request for comment.  Regulators found that Kang steered about $2 billion in fixed-income trades to firms represented by Kelley and Schonhorn beginning in early 2014, resulting in millions of dollars in commissions, of which the two earned between 35 and 40 percent, according to an indictment.  In that time, securities investigators found that the firms' fixed-income business surged, with one of them increasing its domestic bond transactions from zero at the end of fiscal year 2013 to $2.378 billion at the end of fiscal year 2016, making it one of the top broker dealers doing state pension fund business, according to the complaint.  Prosecutors said that in exchange, Kang received a $10,000 all-expenses-paid trip to Montreal, Canada; a ski trip to Park City, Utah; tickets to a Paul McCartney concert in New Orleans; a $17,420 Panerai wristwatch; dinners at upscale restaurants; nights out at strip clubs; prostitutes; and cocaine.  The state's pension fund has been the source of scandal before.  In 2010, a state comptroller pleaded guilty to charges he steered pension funds to a campaign contributor. Further investigations revealed investors' widespread use of so-called placement agents to access pension funds, an arrangement some regulators have likened to pay-to-play.  Kang had been fired in 2012 by a private investment firm for accepting gifts from Schonhorn in exchange for steering fixed-income business, but he lied about his termination when he was hired by the state fund, according to the complaint.  Asked whether state officials properly investigated Kang before hiring him, a spokesman for the comptroller's office said only that ""background checks are a routine part of the hiring process."""
38,Real,"No Government Shutdown: Senate Passes Funding Bill After Democrats Back Down Senate Democrats dropped their objections Friday night to a short-term-funding bill to keep the government running, and the bill passed less than an hour before the midnight deadline.  It's become a familiar year-end act for Congress: passing a short-term-funding bill that will keep the government running for a few more months. This funding measure, which passed 63-36, runs out in April.  Despite overwhelming support in the House on Thursday, the spending package hit a roadblock in the Senate, where coal state Democrats staged a late protest to try to alter provisions affecting miners.  The stopgap includes $45 million to continue health benefits for four months for certain retired coal miners, whose coverage was set to expire at the end of the year. Democrats, led by West Virginia's Joe Manchin, wanted a full-year extension, but with little leverage and a shutdown looming, they relented with a promise to reignite that fight in four months.  ""Would I have preferred that provision to be more generous? Of course I would have,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. ""But we'll be back at it in April, and I think it's highly unlikely that we'll take it away.""  With House lawmakers already back home for the holidays on Friday  and zero interest from GOP leaders to reopen negotiations  Democrats backed down in time to avert a midnight Friday shutdown.  The spending bill keeps the federal government running on autopilot until April 28. Congressional Republicans opted to punt the annual spending bills into next year to wait until President-elect Donald Trump assumes office. With control of both the White House and Congress, Republicans will have more sway over how roughly $1 trillion is spent on federal agencies and programs.  The bill runs through April to buy Congress more time to negotiate the fiscal year 2017 spending bills, because the Senate is expected to be consumed by the confirmation process for Trump administration nominees in the first quarter of next year.  Since the spending bill is a must-pass measure, it also includes some unrelated provisions and additional funding measures. For instance, Senate Republicans included language that will help expedite the confirmation process for Trump's defense secretary nominee, retired Gen. James Mattis.  For Mattis to be confirmed, Congress must waive a law that requires a seven-year cooling-off period for current or former military officials to hold that Cabinet post. Mattis retired in 2013.  Democrats objected to the language, but Republicans said it was necessary to expedite consideration of a critical administration post. The waiver will still be reviewed by the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, and it will need to pass a 60-vote threshold in the Senate.  Mattis has been widely praised on both sides of the aisle and is expected to be confirmed, barring something unforeseen coming to light during the confirmation process.  The measure also includes just over $10 billion in Overseas Contingency Funding, better known as the side Pentagon account that funds the ongoing war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.  An additional $4.1 billion is directed to disaster relief, including recovery efforts from Hurricane Matthew.  Democrats also secured funding to assist the Flint, Mich., community with repairing its drinking water systems. Some $170 million is directed toward infrastructure improvements and preventive care against lead poisoning for mothers and children.  Congress approved a biomedical research bill this week, and the stopgap spending measure includes funds for new programs authorized in the legislation, such as $352 million to the National Institutes of Health for medical research and $500 million to states to combat the opioid epidemic.  The measure also includes a provision that will prevent a pay raise for members of Congress. The pay freeze has been in place since 2010."
39,Real,"Ahead of Pro-Trump Rally, KKK Members Claim They're 'Not White Supremacists' PELHAM, N.C.  In today's racially charged environment, there's a label that even the KKK disavows: white supremacy.  Standing on a muddy dirt road in the dead of night near the North Carolina-Virginia border, masked Ku Klux Klan members claimed Donald Trump's election as president proves whites are taking back America from blacks, immigrants, Jews and other groups they describe as criminals and freeloaders. America was founded by and for whites, they say, and only whites can run a peaceful, productive society.  But still, the KKK members insisted in an interview with The Associated Press, they're not white supremacists, a label that is gaining traction in the country since Trump won with the public backing of the Klan, neo-Nazis and other white racists.  Related: Charleston Church Massacre Survivor Tells of Watching Son Die as Trial Begins  ""We're not white supremacists. We believe in our race,"" said a man with a Midwestern accent and glasses just hours before a pro-Trump Klan parade in a nearby town. He, like three Klan compatriots, wore a robe and pointed hood and wouldn't give his full name, in accordance with Klan rules.  Claiming the Klan isn't white supremacist flies in the face of its very nature. The Klan's official rulebook, the Kloran  published in 1915 and still followed by many groups  says the organization ""shall ever be true in the faithful maintenance of White Supremacy,"" even capitalizing the term for emphasis.  Watchdog groups also consider the Klan a white supremacist organization, and experts say the groups' denials are probably linked to efforts to make their racism more palatable.  Still, KKK groups today typically renounce the term. The same goes for extremists including members of the self-proclaimed ""alt-right,"" an extreme branch of conservatism mixing racism, white nationalism and populism.  ""We are white separatists, just as Yahweh in the Bible told us to be. Separate yourself from other nations. Do not intermix and mongrelize your seed,"" said one of the Klansmen who spoke along the muddy lane.  The Associated Press interviewed the men, who claimed membership in the Loyal White Knights of the KKK, in a nighttime session set up with help of Chris Barker, a KKK leader who confirmed details of the group's ""Trump victory celebration"" in advance of the event. As many as 30 cars paraded through the town of Roxboro, North Carolina, some bearing Confederate and KKK flags.  Barker didn't participate, though: He and a Klan leader from California were arrested hours earlier on charges linked to the stabbing of a third KKK member during a fight, sheriff's officials said. Both men were jailed; the injured man was recovering.  PlaySen. Reid To Trump: Rescind Bannon Appointment Facebook Twitter Google Plus Embed Sen. Reid To Trump: Rescind Bannon Appointment 1:42 Related: Trump's Pick of Steve Bannon as Chief Strategist Sparks Backlash  The Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, which monitor white extremist organizations and are tracking an increase in reports of racist incidents since the election, often use the ""white supremacist"" label when describing groups like the Klan; white nationalism and white separatism are parts of the ideology. But what exactly is involved?  The ADL issued a report last year describing white supremacists as ""ideologically motivated by a series of racist beliefs, including the notion that whites should be dominant over people of other backgrounds, that whites should live by themselves in a whites-only society, and that white people have their own culture and are genetically superior to other cultures.""  That sounds a lot like some of the ideas espoused by today's white radicals, yet they reject the label. That's likely because they learned the lessons of one-time Klan leader David Duke, who unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in Louisiana this year, said Penn State University associate professor Josh Inwood.  ""(There was) this peddling of kinder, softer white supremacy. He tried to pioneer a more respectable vision of the Klan,"" Inwood said."

This particular session took place as journalists continue to protest the fact that Mr. Trump has yet to hold a news conference since his election. Its now been 145 days since his last news conference. He has, since the election, given interviews to CBS News, to New York Times reporters, and to Fox News, but the press conference he was to hold last week about the resolution of his business conflicts was postponed until the new year.  Mike Allen, formerly of Politico and now of Axios, was there and sent a series of tweets about the meeting in the White and Gold ballroom, saying in one that Mr. Trump was relaxed and chatty and that pictures were allowed of the off-the-record session.   Many of the journalists who attended, including Allen, saw an uptick in outraged tweets aimed at them, though this one, from cartoonist Ann Telnaes, summed up the reaction visually.

Since leaving the White House, Bossert has run a national security consulting business and served as a fellow at the Atlantic Council focusing on cybersecurity.  Mr. Trumps transition team said the position for which Bossert was selected has recently been performed by a deputy to the National Security Advisor, but that in Mr. Trumps administration the job is being elevated and restored to its independent status.  Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (ret.) will serve as Mr. Trumps National Security Advisor.  I am looking forward to working closely with Gen. Flynn as we together help the President-elect advance the interests of the United States and its allies, Bossert said in a statement."
42,Satire,"WALKER ASSURES G.O.P. VOTERS HE IS AS HORRIBLE AS TRUMP MADISON, WISCONSIN (The Borowitz Report)  Serving notice that he intends to go toe-to-toe with the controversial real-estate mogul, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker used the official announcement of his Presidential candidacy to assure Republican voters that he is as horrible as Donald Trump.  Donald Trump has grabbed a lot of headlines over the past few weeks by spewing bigotry and venom, Walker told an enthusiastic crowd of supporters. I want to make it clear that when it comes to those things, I take a back seat to no one.  Concluding his speech with a line that triggered a standing ovation, Walker said, To those who thought Donald Trump was the only sociopath in the race, let me say this: not anymore.  Prior to his announcement, aides to the Wisconsin governor had privately fretted that by establishing his identity as an arrogant and ill-informed merchant of hatred, Trump had appropriated Walkers brand.  In the hopes of proving that Trump has no monopoly on odiousness, aides have released a point-by-point comparison showing that on such key issues as workers rights and health care, Walker is just as terrifying as the former reality-show host.  Acknowledging that Trump has dominated media attention for now, Walkers aides believe that the governor will eventually reclaim his rightful mantle as the worst person in the race.  Sooner or later, the Trump candidacy is going to fall apart and voters are going to be looking for another dick to vote for, one aide said. Scott Walker wants to be that dick."
43,Fake,"Pro-Cruz Robocall Warns Nevada Voters of Impending Missile Strike CARSON CITY, Nv.  A robocall dialed out to hundreds of thousands of conservative voters on Tuesday warned of an imminent missile strike on several cities in Nevada, including the state capital, Carson City. The call prompted a mass evacuation of potential Republican supporters from the state and has been blamed for at least twenty-five deaths.  Just hours before the start of Nevadas Republican caucus, potential voters received a forty-five second prerecorded phone call informing them that New York, Washington, and Los Angeles had just been obliterated by ballistic missiles. Evacuation orders have been issued for your state, the call calmly explained. You are to immediately report to your precincts designated polling center for further instructions.  The vast majority of those who received Tuesday afternoons robocall -perhaps out of fear of nuclear annihilation- didnt stay on the line long enough to find out that the call had been paid for by Ted Cruz for President and, according to the Texas senators campaign manager, was meant to merely warn voters of the dangers of a Trump presidency.  In an interview with MSNBCs Chuck Todd, Senator Cruz said that such calls are common during primary season and accused his fellow candidates of forming a behind-the-scenes alliance in order to conduct a dishonest and misleading smear campaign against him. The senator expressed sadness over the tragic loss of at least two-dozen potential voters who perished trying to flee a fictitious Nevadan Hiroshima but blamed his rivals for taking parts of the call out of context in order to discredit him at the expense of the good people of Nevada.  Meanwhile, statements released by the Trump and Rubio camps called for a complete redo of the Nevada caucus. While Senator Rubio accused Cruz of denying people their constitutional rights; Donald Trump complained that Cruzs deceptive tactics had likely cost him millions of votes.  The Nevada caucus marks the final GOP primary leading up to Super Tuesday on March 1st."
44,Fake,"President Obama, Jon Stewart to Moderate Fifth GOP Debate NEW YORK, Ny.  During a Democratic fundraiser in New York last Monday, President Barack Obama announced he has signed a contract with CNN to co-moderate the fifth GOP debate with former Daily Show host Jon Stewart. Set for December 15th in Las Vegas, Nevada, the debate is tentatively focused on foreign policy.  They need a little touch of reality, the president said, receiving a wide applause from the audience. This isnt an audition for the babysitters club, its the Oval Office. In the past, President Obama has publicly questioned whether or not the current Republican presidential hopefuls possess the intellectual and moral fortitude required to run the country.   Presidential debates shouldnt be centered around catering to the candidates comfort level, said CNN political analyst Melissa Cunningham, referring to the most recent CNBC debate which prompted a failed attempt by the GOP to harness control of future debates. Cunningham continued, Itll be interesting to see how they field questions from a seasoned politician, particularly one that knows the ins and outs of the job theyre vying for.  Meanwhile, former Vice Presidential nominee and reality TV star Sarah Palin railed against the Obama administration for once again trying to sandbag the Republican party and suggested the president might be better suited leading a morning call to prayer.  Former Daily Show host Jon Stewart, who many speculate will play good cop to President Obamas bad cop during the debate, visited the White House this week to brainstorm possible debate questions with the president. Im told the meeting was very constructive, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Tuesday afternoon.  Fox News will host the fourth installment of the Republican presidential debates on November 10th in Milwaukee. Subsequently, the fifth GOP debate, featuring President Obama and Jon Stewart, is scheduled to air December 15th at 6 p.m. PST on CNN. The event will be held at The Venetian in Las Vegas."

46,Real,"Contradicting settled science, Donald Trump says ""nobody really knows"" on climate change Donald Trump said again on Sunday that he is open-minded about climate change -- but also that nobody really knows the truth about the issue, which contradicts the fact that there is near-universal scientific agreement on the issue.  In an interview with Fox News Sunday, moderator Chris Wallace pointed out to Mr. Trump  that in the space of a week he bothmet with former Vice President Al Gore and appointed Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, a climate change denier who has opposed many environmental regulations, to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Where, Wallace asked, does Mr. Trump stands on climate change?  Im very open-minded. Im still open-minded, he said. Nobody really knows.  However, there is a near-universal scientific consensus that climate change is a real phenomenon -- despite continued opposition to the notion among primarily Republican politicians. NASAs website on climate change, for example, notes that approximately 97 percent of publishing climate scientists agree that human activities are very likely responsible for rising temperatures.  His comments came just days after his transition team created a questionnaire with 74 questions for Energy Department officials to identify employees who had been involved in international climate talks over the last five years, as well as employees who have helped develop Obama administration climate policies.  The questionnaire, obtained by CBS News and first reported by Bloomberg News, asks, for example, Which programs within [the Department of Energy] are essential to meeting the goals of President Obamas Climate Action Plan?  Mr. Trumps answer Sunday on the climate change issue is similar to the one he gave in a meeting with the editorial board of The New York Times last month -- after a campaign in which Mr. Trump repeatedly insisted climate change was a hoax invented by China.  I have a very open mind, he said at the time. And Im going to study a lot of the things that happened on it and were going to look at it very carefully. But I have an open mind.  Still, Mr. Trump said his reason for choosing Pruitt -- whom many environmental groups immediately blasted -- was to speed up the process for permit approvals and other EPA business.  If you look at what Chinas doing. If you look at what -- I could name country after country, he said. You look at whats happening in Mexico where our people are just -- plants are being built and they dont wait 10 years to get an approval to build a plant, okay? They build it like the following day or the following week. We cant let all of these permits that take forever to get stop our jobs.  As for the Paris Agreement, the landmark international climate agreement that went into effect this fall, Mr. Trump said he is studying the agreement -- but that he worries it will put the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage. International energy and environment experts worry that Mr. Trump, who said earlier this year that he would tear up the Paris deal, could throw the entire agreement into jeopardy.  Paris, Im studying, he said. I do say this: I dont want that agreement to put us at a competitive disadvantage with other countries. And as you know, there are different times and different time limits on that agreement. I dont want that to give China, or other countries signing agreements an advantage over us."
47,Real,"Key Union Backs Tom Perez for DNC Chair, Breaking With AFL-CIO The International Association of Firefighters, the main union representing American firefighters, has placed itself on a collision course with the AFL-CIO in the race for the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee, deciding to back Labor Secretary Tom Perez over Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison.  The Democratic leadership contest has taken on unusual significance in the wake of Hillary Clinton's devastating loss last month, dividing the labor movement between two Democrats whom it has long seen as allies.  The AFL-CIO, a federation of 55 unions that includes the IAFF, endorsed Ellison just before Perez entered the race last week, despite protests from IAFF President Harold Schaitberger and others.  In a statement, Schaitberger praised Perez as a ""a tireless advocate for civil and human rights"" who can transcend what the union president called ""a narrow focus on identity and cultural politics that alienated"" some longtime Democrats from the party.  ""Tom Perez is the person who has the right mix of personal background, progressive values, experience and total commitment to all workers, in all regions and states across the country,"" Schaitberger said. ""To have Tom Perez as the Chair of one of our nation's two major political parties would be a significant victory for workers across America.""  Perez, the son of Dominican immigrants, has been leaning on his heritage to appeal to Latino DNC members. But Schaitberger, whose union is on the conservative end of the spectrum, said the Labor Secretary is the best person to reorient the party around ""a strong economic message that is truly inclusive of everyone.""  Ellison, an African-American convert to Islam who supported Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential primary, has faced questions over past associations with Nation of Islam founder Louis Farrakhan, whom he long ago disowned.  Schaitberger earlier spoke out against the AFL-CIO's endorsement process, which gave its executive committee members only three options: Vote to endorse Ellison, abstain, or make no endorsement.  That vote was an attempt to present a united front from the labor movement, which is well represented among the voting members of the DNC, and to avoid a damaging intraparty squabble.  But the IAFF is the second major union in the AFL-CIO to back Perez, and more defections may come.  On Friday, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union  one of the country's largest unions, with 1.3 million members  came out in support of the labor secretary, saying its members ""saw firsthand his passion and commitment"" to their issues during his work heading the Department of Labor.  Another union, the United Farm Workers, endorsed Perez on Monday. Their membership is small, but the endorsement comes with a symbolic connection to famed labor leader Cesar Chavez, who founded the union.  ""He has been a lifelong friend of labor and immigrants. When farm workers needed him, Tom Perez stood up and fought,"" said UFW President Arturo Rodriguez, noting it was the first time the union has ever endorsed in a DNC chair race. ""He played a key role in helping farm workers in California win the same overtime pay protections as all other workers, and in doing so is helping end 78 years of race-based discrimination.""  Play Could Ellison be the next DNC chair? Facebook Twitter Google Plus Embed Could Ellison be the next DNC chair? 5:26 However, Ellison has the backing of a number of powerful individual unions in addition to the AFL-CIO, including two of the very biggest: The American Federation of Teachers and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.  Their support was a coup for Ellison not only because of their size, but because both were active Clinton allies, an important point as Ellison works to expand his support beyond his base among Sanders supporters.  The election for DNC chair will be held in February during a party meeting in Atlanta, but will feature a series of regional forums where candidates will discuss their platforms before then."
48,Fake,"Egyptian paper: Transcript proves Kerry plotted UN resolution against Israel with Palestinians  Report On Tuesday, the Times of Israel reported that an Egyptian newspaper published what it called transcripts of meetings between top US officials  including Secretary of State John Kerry  and Palestinian officials that could, if true, prove Israels accusations that the Obama regime was behind the anti-Israel UN resolution approved by the Security Council.  According to the Times of Israel:  At the same time, a report in an Israeli daily Tuesday night pointed to Britain helping draft the resolution and high drama in the hours leading up to the vote, as Jerusalem tried to convince New Zealand to bury the Security Council measure.  In a meeting in early December with top Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, US Secretary of State John Kerry told the Palestinians that the US was prepared to cooperate with the Palestinians at the Security council, Israels Channel 1 TV said, quoting the Egyptian Al-Youm Al-Sabea newspaper.  Also present at the meeting were US National Security Adviser Susan Rice, and Majed Faraj, director of the Palestinian Authoritys General Intelligence Service.  Kerry is quoted as saying that he could present his ideas for a final status solution if the Palestinians pledge they will support the proposed framework. The US officials advised the Palestinians to travel to Riyadh to present the plan to Saudi leaders.  According to the Times, the Egyptian report fits Israeli claims that it has ironclad proof the Obama regime helped craft the anti-settlement resolution.  We have ironclad information that emanates from sources in the Arab world and that shows the Obama administration helped craft this resolution and pushed hard for its eventual passage, said David Keyes, spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  Additionally, the Guardian said Israel may provide this information to the incoming Trump administration:  Doubling down on the claim a few hours later the controversial Israeli ambassador to Washington, Ron Dermer, went even further suggesting it had gathered evidence that it would present to the incoming Trump administration.  We will present this evidence to the new administration through the appropriate channels. If they want to share it with the American people, they are welcome to do it, Dermer told CNN.  According to Dermer, not only did the US not stand by Israels side during the vote, it was behind this ganging up on Israel at the UN.  Jeff Dunetz noted:  Israel fears that Kerry lays out his comprehensive vision for two-state solution and then turns it into another Security Council resolution imposing additional anti-Israel settlement terms on Israel, or at upcoming peace conference in Paris on Jan. 15 that Israel is not attending, all before the Israel-hating Obama leaves the White House three weeks from this coming Friday. Another possibility is the US recognizing a Palestinian State, any of the above eliminates the possibility of a negotiated solution.  The Egyptian report did not detail whose transcripts of the meeting it had obtained or how it had obtained them.  At the end of the meeting, the report said,  Rice and Kerry requested that the content of the discussion remain secret because of the sensitivity of the matter during the transition period in the U.S. The same way Kerry kept negotiations for the Iran deal secret from Israel until it was too late.  The Obama regime, however, has denied allegations that it was behind the resolution.  We did not draft this resolution; we did not introduce this resolution. We made this decision when it came up for a vote, Obama deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said Friday."
49,Fake,"SARAH PALIN APPOINTED AS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ADVISER, PROMISES TO GET RID OF CLIMATE CHANGE HYSTERIA The American President-elect Donald Trump has officially announced this morning that Sarah Palin is to become the new Science and Technology Adviser.  Critics of the administration have already voiced their concerns over the choice of the former Alaska governor, known to be a fierce climate change denier, to lead the White House Office of Science and Technology of the United States.  Far too long has the Chinese narrative over climate change kept our economy in a rut. Its time to open the pumps and as I like to say: Drill, baby, drill!  Sarah Palin, former Alaska governor  whitehousepalin Scientists and academics alike have already voiced concerns that Sarah Palins strong disbelief in climate change could have dramatic consequences for the planet. God killed the dinosaurs  Some scientists openly fear that Sarah Palin could be the end of the science establishment as we know it and would relegate the Office of Science and Technology to the dark ages.  I mean, this is scary as hell explains climatologist Dan B. Evans from the University of California, Berkeley.  The woman claimed in an interview in 2009 that God killed the dinosaurs and that he had sent the flood to purge the dinosaurs off of the earth, he warned, visibly concerned.  With Sarah Palin as director of the Office of Science and Technology, we are definitely stepping into la-la land he adds.  A scientific community in disbelief  Sarah Palins strong stance against climate change in the past has earned her an army of detractors, especially within environmentalist circles.  In a 2009 UN statement that acknowledged that 97% of climate experts agree humans are causing global warming, Sarah Palin responded, the documents show that there was no real consensus even within the CRU crowd and called the 2007 IPCC report a load of rubbish and a fraud.  With irresponsible leaders such as Trump and Palin in the White House, polar ice cap melting will increase dramatically and waters could rise an easy 33% in the next ten years has even admitted James Hillocks, a top Greenpeace climate scientist.  Environmentalists fear the worst as President-elect Donald Trump has already threatened to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Pact, potentially dealing a death blow to the whole accord by refuting the international consensus on climate change, believe experts."
50,Real,"Newly certified Trump feuds with Bill Clinton Now that the Electoral College has officially made him president-elect, Donald Trump spent Tuesday holding meetings and feuding with former president Bill Clinton.  Responding to criticism from the ex-president, Trump said he and 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton lost this year's election because they failed to pay attention to essential states.  ""They focused on wrong states,"" Trump said in a brief tweet burst.  In an interview with a weekly newspaper in New York state, Clinton said that Trump ""doesn't know much,"" but ""one thing he does know is how to get angry, white men to vote for him."" Clinton also said that Trump called him after the election, another source of dispute between the two men.  Tweeted Trump: ""Bill Clinton stated that I called him after the election. Wrong, he called me (with a very nice congratulations).""

Trump wins Electoral College vote as insurgency fizzles Bill Clinton: Hillary 'couldn't prevail' over Russians, FBI While losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by more than 2.8 million, Trump triumphed in the Electoral College by winning more states.

These terrorists and their regional and worldwide networks must be eradicated from the face of the earth, a mission we will carry out with all freedom-loving partners.""

51,Real,"Key GOP senators join call for bipartisan Russia election probe, even as their leaders remain mum Two Senate Republicans joined demands for a bipartisan probe into Russias suspected election interference allegedly designed to bolster Donald Trump as questions continue to mount about the president-elects expected decision to nominate a secretary of state candidate with close ties to Russia.  Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.)  the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee  joined calls by incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) and Armed Services ranking Democrat Jack Reed (R.I.) for a thorough, bipartisan investigation of Russian influence in the U.S. elections. Their statement came two days after The Washington Post reported the CIAs private conclusion that Russias activities were intended to tip the scales to help Trump.  Recent reports of Russian interference in our election should alarm every American, the four senators said in a statement on Sunday morning. Democrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks.  This cannot become a partisan issue. The stakes are too high for our country. We are committed to working in this bipartisan manner, and we will seek to unify our colleagues around the goal of investigating and stopping the grave threats that cyberattacks conducted by foreign governments pose to our national security, they added.   Republican senators John McCain (Arizona) and Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) have been highly have been highly critical of Donald Trumps comments about Russia. (Michael Reynolds/EPA)  But McCain and Graham  who frequently criticized Trump before and after his election  have often bucked Republican leaders, and their embrace of a wide-ranging Russia probe does not necessarily signal support from other Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Sen. Susan Collins (Maine), one of the more moderate Republicans in the upper chamber, suggested a bipartisan investigation may be useful toward achieving an objective accounting of any alleged meddling by foreign adversaries.  The purpose of any investigation, whether by the Obama administration or Congress, is not to question or relitigate the results of any past or present Presidential election, she said in a statement. Instead, any review must focus on the long overdue task of improving the defenses of the United States against cyber attacks, including those that might seek to affect or influence political campaign.  Another GOP senator  Sen. James Lankford (Okla.), who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee  agreed with McCain and Grahams decision to support a bipartisan investigation of suspected cyber intrusion by Russia in the U.S. elections.  Cybersecurity investigation of Russian interference cant be partisan, Lankford tweeted Sunday.  Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committees chairman, Richard Burr (R-N.C.), said Sunday that the panel will continue to conduct vigorous oversight of all intelligence matters.  But he made no specific mention of Russia, unlike Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said cyber threats by Americas rivals, including Russia, pose serious challenges that should not be politicized or viewed through a partisan lens.  Johnson said as chairman Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations panel he would continue to hold hearings based on fact  not innuendo  for the sole purpose of informing effective policy and appropriate countermeasures.  Republicans may be loath to join calls for such a wide-ranging investigation into Russias election-related activities given that Trump has dismissed the CIA claims as ridiculous. They may worry about picking an obvious fight with the president-elect before he is even inaugurated. Trump has signaled he wants a warmer relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he praised during the campaign.  I think its just another excuse. I dont believe it .?.?. No, I dont believe it at all, Trump said of the CIA charges on Fox News Sunday. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway echoed her boss on CBSs Face the Nation, saying that such allegations from the intelligence community were laughable and ridiculous.  Trump also played down the importance of receiving the daily intelligence briefing, a tradition for presidents and presidents-elect. He has received the briefings only sporadically since winning the election.  A U.S. intelligence official said it is concerning that intelligence on Russia relating to the election is being dismissed out of hand as false or politically partisan.  The inclination to ignore such intelligence and impugn the integrity of U.S. intelligence officials is contrary to all that is sacred to national security professionals who work day and night to protect this country, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.  Trump denies CIA's assessment that Russia tried to help him win election  Play Video2:37 CIA officials told senators it is now quite clear that electing Donald Trump was Russias goal. In an interview on Fox News Sunday on Dec. 11, President-elect Trump denied the CIA's assessment. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) [Trump denies CIA report that Russia intervened to help him win election]  McConnell himself has been notably silent since the Post report was published on Friday night, and his number-two, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), downplayed the significance of it in a series of tweets  although some of them suggested Congresss review of Russian actions should broaden.  All this news of Russian hacking: it has been going on for years. Serious, but hardly news, Cornyn tweeted Saturday.  The Texas Republican seemed to support, however, a wider look at Russia as a global actor rather than one confined to its role in the U.S. election, retweeting the below tweet from Graham: Cyber-attacks, undermining NATO, Ukraine, butchery in Syria, etc. I intend to look at all things Russia  not just election influence.  Meanwhile, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), in his first substantial comment on Russian hacking since the report Friday, said Sunday he rejects any politicization of intelligence matters, calling foreign intervention unacceptable.  For the most part, other key Republicans were silent on the issue of whether to embrace a bipartisan look at whether  Putins government was behind the hacks of the Democratic National Committee emails and their publication by WikiLeaks in an alleged bid to help Trump and damage Hillary Clintons campaign.  At the same time, several Republican senators raised concerns about Trumps likely nomination of Rex Tillerson, ExxonMobils chief executive, as secretary of state due to his  ties to Putin. Republicans in a 52-to-48 Senate have only the slimmest of margins to get him confirmed, should Democrats decide to uniformly oppose the nomination. Only three Republicans would need to side with Democrats in order to defeat Tillerson.  The potential nomination sparked a backlash among the partys traditional hawks who oppose Putin, and some senior strategists feared that more than a handful of Republicans would outright oppose his nomination  requiring Trump to find Democratic support in order to confirm his potential Secretary of State.  Its a matter of concern to me that he has such a close relationship with Vladimir Putin, that that would color his approach to Vladimir Putin and the Russian threat, McCain told CBSs Face the Nation.  Being a friend of Vladimir is not an attribute I am hoping for from a Secretary of State, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) tweeted Sunday.  Republicans outnumber Democrats by only one vote on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which must approve a secretary of state nominee before the full Senate votes. Over the weekend, several committee Democrats, including Sens. Robert Menendez (N.J.) and Christopher A. Coons (Del.), stated their deep skepticism of Tillerson as a candidate.  In a post on Facebook, Menendez called the idea Tillerson could be named secretary of state alarming and absurd, concluding that the Trump administration would be guaranteeing Russia has a willing accomplice in the Presidents Cabinet guiding our nations foreign policy.  Yet the committees chairman, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.)  who was considered a possible pick for Trumps secretary of state  has said Tillerson would be a good choice.  If it is Rex Tillerson, he is a very good individual, Corker tweeted.  Should Tillerson make it to a floor vote, Democrats could not block the nomination alone. If Democrats stick together, Republicans must muster at least 50 of the 52 votes they will have to successfully confirm him, as Vice President-elect Mike Pence could cast the tiebreaking vote.  Graham has already also strongly hinted that he might oppose the nomination.  I dont know the man much at all, but lets put it this way: If you received an award from the Kremlin, order of friendship, then were gonna have some talkin, Graham said early Saturday morning. Well have some questions. I dont want to prejudge the guy but thats a bit unnerving."
52,Fake,"Electoral voters now subjected to brutal wave of death threats and intimidation psyops faithless votes being coerced to throw the election (NaturalNews) If a thug points a gun to your head, hands you a piece of paper, and says, Sign this contract, is the contract legally binding?  Of course it isnt. It was coerced under the threat of violence, and no court in the nation would uphold the contract as legally binding.  Yet right now, electoral voters all across America are being essentially held at gunpoint, threatened with being killed if they dont change their votes to oppose Donald Trump. The dishonest mainstream media is further amplifying the coercion by running an organized psyop campaign of disinfo (psyop means psychological operations) which falsely claims the Russians hacked the election, despite the complete absence of a shred of evidence to support the narrative.  The Russian hack conspiracy delusion has already been completely discredited. It turns out the DNC emails were leaked by a democrat insider who supported Bernie Sanders. The handing over of the emails took place in a wooded area in Washington D.C. and had nothing whatsoever to do with the Russians.  Electors around the country are being harassed with a barrage of emails, phone calls and letters  and even death threats  in an effort to block Donald Trump from being voted in as president by the Electoral College on Monday, reports the NY Post today.  The NY Post also reports:  Reports of GOP electors being badgered have been reported in numerous states, including Georgia, Idaho, Tennessee, Arizona, Utah and Michigan.  For Michael Banerian, a senior at Oakland University in Michigan and a Republican elector, the harassment comes with a dark side.  He said hes been getting death threats via email, snail mail, Twitter and Facebook.  Somebody threatened to put a bullet in the back of my mouth, Banerian, 22, told The Post on Wednesday.  Leftists are kidnapping electoral voters and holding them for ransom  What you may not know is that these death threats are a coordinated campaign to threaten electoral voters into throwing the election. Yet the very existence of such persistent, coordinated death threats means that We the People must correct the electoral votes, knowing that many such votes will be cast under the threat of being killed. Thus, electoral votes cast under threat or violence are not legally binding. They may be reclaimed by the courts and corrected to represent the will of the voters in their states.  In essence, the political left  organized by international terrorist money man George Soros and people with ties to both the White House and Hillary Clinton  has psychologically kidnapped the electoral voters, and theyre demanding a kind of ransom or they will be killed. That ransom is a vote for anyone other than Donald Trump.  In other words, this is a political mugging where the radical left is holding a gun to their heads and saying, Your vote or your life.  And if they manage to switch 37 electoral votes through such death threats, the left will declare a victory for America, proclaiming the very people they threatened with being killed as being heroes for saving the country.  Unbelievable, isnt it? This is right out of the Kim Jong-Un playbook for how to run a brutal dictatorship, which is probably why the radical left loves it so much. If you do what they want, youre heralded as a national hero. If you dont do what they want, you get a bullet in the head.  This really is the way liberals exert power, by the way, which is precisely why the DNC leaks happened in the first place: Some Bernie Sanders supporters were so angry at the Clinton collusion and corruption, they decided to expose the DNC by handing over leaked emails to Wikileaks. The democrats only have themselves to blame for losing the election because the truth came out.  Lawless democrats have no respect for real democracy theyre pushing America toward a civil war they will quickly lose  What these tactics reveal is how lawless democrats have no respect whatsoever for the laws of this nation. Acting as crybullies and domestic terrorists, if they dont get their way, they threaten to shoot everybody who disagrees with them. (Sound familiar? Look up the history of Chinas Cultural Revolution.)  Thats the kind of behavior we see from totalitarian dictators in places like Cuba, North Korea or Communist China. And its perfectly aligned with the tyrannical philosophy of the political left: If they dont get their way, they threaten to kill everyone who opposes them.  Ive got news for those who espouse such threats of violence, coercion and lawlessness: We the People will stop you by invoking the Second Amendment to protect the Republic. And after we stop you, we will imprison you and charge you with crimes of treason. From there, the courts can decide what punishment is appropriate for your crimes.  Once President Trump is sworn into office, I hope he unleashes a massive investigation into all those who made death threats against the electoral voters. Those individuals must be arrested, imprisoned and charged with serious felony crimes, including sedition. Putting a gun to the heads of electoral voters is a very serious thing. It threatens the sanctity of the entire Republic. Such threats cannot go unpunished.  Hey, we can finally put all those FEMA camps to good use!  In observing all this, Ive come to realize the radical left is going to push America into a civil war. But I also believe a civil war wont last very long because the left will be very quickly defeated by a combination of police, military and armed American patriots fighting alongside law enforcement.  It turns out all those FEMA camps will come in handy after all: Thats where we can put all the left-wing terrorists and traitors who tried (but failed) to overthrow the country. There, well pump in broadcasts of Sean Hannity and Michael Savage until we break the NLP hypnosis programming the left-wingers have been subjected to for the last eight years under Obama, a master of linguistic subterfuge.  Over time, some of them might be rehabilitated to the point where they can rejoin society as sane, rational citizens instead of the mentally ill crybullies they are today. After all, we want to help these people heal their mental illness wherever possible. Unlike the radical left which wants to kill everyone they dont agree with, conservative Americans are far more interested in saving lives and uplifting our fellow brothers and sisters, no matter what sort of psychological trauma they were subjected to by CNN, the Washington Post and the New York Times.  Remember: The same kind of psyop the media is running right now against the electoral voters has been pursued for years against liberals and progressives. Thats why they are so traumatized by reality: Theyve been poisoned, programmed, hypnotized and traumatized by the left-wing media for as long as they can remember!  Its time to finally set all Americans free from the psychological prisons that have been built for them by the corrupt political left. That effort begins anew on January 20, 2017, which is precisely why the radical left is planning to stage a mass uprising on that day. They last thing the left wants is Americans who arent subjected to a daily dose of left-wing propaganda.  Stay tuned to NaturalNews.com and NewsTarget.com for more details as all this moves forward. Im also launching a new live broadcast show in 2017 to cover breaking news in real time."
53,Real,"Intelligence figures fear Trump reprisals over assessment of Russia election role Legislators overseeing the CIA and other intelligence agencies have told the Guardian they will be vigilant about reprisals from Donald Trump over an internal assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to ensure Trumps victory.  Fears of retaliation rose within US intelligence agencies over a tense weekend that saw Trump publicly dismiss not only the assessment but the basic competence of the intelligence apparatus.  When the president-elects transition team is attempting to discredit the entire intelligence community [IC], it has never been more important for the IC and Congress to guard against possible political pressure or retaliation against intelligence analysts, Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, told the Guardian.  Like his Democratic colleagues on the panel, Wyden is pressing Barack Obama for additional public disclosures revealing Russian electoral interference. Such pressure has placed the CIA and other intelligence agencies between the incoming president to whom they will soon answer and a chorus of legislators, mostly but not exclusively Democrats, who consider the Russia hack a national emergency.  It is not possible to gauge precisely how deep fears of retaliation run within the intelligence world. Two currently serving intelligence officers told the Guardian this weekend they had not heard their colleagues express such concerns.  One noted that civil-service laws prevented Trump from launching a purge, but also called attention to a report that Trump is combing through the energy department bureaucracy to identify people who have attended climate change policy conferences.  Former intelligence officers told the Guardian they considered retaliation by Trump to be all but a certainty after he is sworn into office next month. Trump still has several appointments to make at the highest levels of the intelligence apparatus, picks which are likely to be bellwethers for the new presidents attitudes toward the agencies.  There is not just smoke here. There is a 10-alarm fire, the sirens are wailing, the Russians provided the lighter fluid Glenn Carle, former CIA officer There is not just smoke here. There is a blazing 10-alarm fire, the sirens are wailing, the Russians provided the lighter fluid, and Trump is standing half-burnt and holding a match, said Glenn Carle, a retired CIA officer and interrogator.  The facts hurt, Trump wont like the truth, and he will without question seek to destroy those individuals or organizations that say or do anything that he thinks harm his precious grandiosity.  After congressional Democrats called for additional briefings and public disclosures about an intelligence consensus that Russia made a deliberate decision to intervene in the election, Barack Obama ordered a new review of the evidence.  On Friday, the Washington Post reported that intelligence sources believe the Russians decided to penetrate the Democratic National Committees digital networks with the goal of aiding Trump, not merely to spread uncertainty about the outcome of the election.  In response, Trump attacked the credibility of the intelligence agencies on which he will rely for early warning of security emergencies and geopolitical developments. His transition team said in a statement: These are the same people who said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.  Adam Schiff, the leading Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said Trump cannot abide the idea that Russian hacking helped his campaign and was lashing out in a manner that undermined confidence in his handling of intelligence.  If Trump is willing to disregard sound intelligence now, and demean the hard-working and patriotic Americans who produced it, I fear what he will do as president when confronted with unpleasant truths, Schiff said.  Will he accept the best insights of our agencies, or punish them for daring to contradict his assumptions?  Trumps clash with the CIA comes at a moment of acute turmoil within intelligence circles. Obama officials jeopardized the tenure of National Security Agency chief Mike Rogers in a seemingly thwarted bureaucratic reorganization of the US surveillance and cybersecurity apparatus. Congressional sources have told the Guardian they expect to hold a public hearing on the issue in January.  Should Trump go through with the reshuffle, it will leave him appointing an NSA director as well as a director of national intelligence, after James Clapper announced his resignation last month. Trump has also been noncommittal about retaining the FBI director, James Comey, whose bureau houses significant sympathy for Trump.  Congressional Republicans are in an uncomfortable position, between a president of their own party and Russia, a traditional adversary.  Devin Nunes, a California Republican who chairs the House intelligence committee, said on Saturday Russian electoral hacking was no surprise. He also blamed Obama for coming late to the threat out of delusions of resetting relations with Russia  a policy that Trump is also pursuing.  On Sunday, anti-Trump GOP hawks Lindsey Graham and John McCain offered a different path, joining with leading Democratic senators Chuck Schumer and Jack Reed to plead for a bipartisan inquiry into the alleged Russian hacking, which they said endangered the country.  We have an obligation to inform the public about recent cyberattacks that have cut to the heart of our free society, the senators said in a joint statement.  Democrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks.  Trump: reports that Russia influenced US election are ridiculous Also on Sunday, Elijah Cummings, the Maryland Democrat on the investigations-heavy House oversight committee, pressured the Republican committee chairman, Jason Chaffetz, and speaker of the house Paul Ryan to join us now in our effort to launch a robust and truly bipartisan investigation of Russian interference in our election that puts our nations interests over the interests of any political party.   FBI covered up Russian influence on Trump's election win, Harry Reid claims Read more Carle, the retired CIA officer, said Trumps temperament had played into Russias hands and put the president-elect on a collision course with the CIA.  He said: Look, in my professional assessment as an intelligence officer, Trump has a reflexive, defensive, monumentally narcissistic personality, for whom the facts and national interest are irrelevant, and the only thing that counts is whatever gives personal advantage and directs attention to himself.  He is about the juiciest intelligence target an intelligence office could imagine. He groans with vulnerabilities. He will only work with individuals or entities that agree with him and build him up, and he is a shockingly easy intelligence target to manipulate.  Were Trump an intelligence officer himself, Carle said, he would be removed and possibly charged with having accepted the clandestine support of a hostile power to the harm of the United States.  A senior intelligence official who was not cleared to talk to reporters supported the push to declassify additional material on the serious matter of the alleged Russian electoral interference, since it happened on our watch."
54,Fake,"TRAITOR-IN-CHIEF: Heres The SICK REASON Newt Gingrich Just Betrayed Donald Trump Newt Gingrich has been waging an INSANE jihad against Donald Trump over the Mexican Judge comments made earlier in the week. Many people are going to be disappointed by this, but Newt flipped sides because of the money.  The mainstream media reported earlier last month that Sheldon Adelson was willing to contribute $100 million to Trumps campaign. It was not reported much, but there was another $100 million that was offered to Trump if he picked Newt Gingrich. Thats why Gingrich was so nice to Trump.    When Trump the entire offer.declined the entire offer. Gingrich started lashing out at him publicly. He even recently claimed that the comments Trump made about the judge were one of his worst mistakes. All Trump did was point out publicly that the Trump University lawyer has ties to the La Raza Hispanic nationalist organization.  I DONT KNOW WHAT TRUMPS REASONING WAS, AND I DONT CARE, GINGRICH TOLD THE WASHINGTON POST.  What a traitor. Its hard to see it happen because a lot of people were hoping that Newt would be the VP. It is now showing that he is just bitter for having Trump change his mind.  Its in Trumps best interest to pick someone that identifies with him ideologically as his VP. This makes a lot of sense because Gingrich has done an almost complete 180 since last week. But, we shouldnt be too torn up about it  remember that Newt Gingrich wanted a moon base at one point.    *** Bye, Bye, Newt. Have fun as the leader of the moon.

56,Real,"Report: Trump team questions costs of State Department's environment efforts Donald Trumps transition team is asking State Department officials to reveal how much of their funding goes towards international environmental groups, according to a new Washington Post report.  The query, posed in a list of questions to the State Departments Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, asked, How much does the Department of State contribute annually to international environmental organizations in which the department participates?  State Department spokesperson John Kirby noted Wednesday, however, that there is nothing out of hte norm regarding questions being asked by the transition team.  The questions, Kirby told reporters, were very much aligned with their need to better understand the bureaucracy and organization that theyre about to lead.  Nothing falls outside the normal inquiries, Kirby said.  Despite State Department assurances, the inquiry has increased worries that the president-elects transition team is prioritizing a rollback of the Obama administrations actions on climate change and conservation efforts.  While Mr. Trump has met with prominent climate change activists since his election victory, the president-elect has also tapped several people to lead government agencies that have agendas contrary to Mr. Obamas own climate and renewable fuel focus. For instance, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt -- who Mr. Trump has chosen to lead the Environmental Protection Agency -- is a vocal denier of climate change science and has even sued the Obama administration over its clean power plant rules. Mr. Trumps pick for secretary of state, oil magnate Rex Tillerson, has said climate change could pose significant risks, but there is little indication that the Exxon Mobil executive will prioritze the issue.  Mr. Trump also threatened during his campaign to scuttle the United States involvement in the landmark Paris climate change accord, an international agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions and try to reverse global warming effects. The Paris treaty holds the U.S. accountable for donating $3 billion over four years to the Green Climate Fund, which is devoted to helping poorer countries weather the detrimental effects of climate change.  Similarly, the Energy Department was also recently sent a questionnaire to divulge the names of employees who had worked on climate change policies. The department said it would not be complying with that request, and the Trump transition team disavowed the original questionnaire, saying it was not authorized.  The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment confirming the Post report.  According to the White Houses Office of Management and Budget, of the State Departments 2016 budget of $30.91 billion, about $128 million was allocated for natural resources and the environment."

Our adversarial relationships with Cuba and Iran took years of frostiness and saber-rattling to maintain, Harland Dorrinson, the executive director of the Washington-based Institute for Infinite Conflict, said. Thanks to the President, decades of well-crafted hostility have been thrown out the window.  According to Dorrinson, fears abound in conservative circles that the President might be capriciously casting about for other powder kegs to defuse during his remaining time in office.  If his shameful record is any guide, hell probably try to disarm North Korea, Dorrinson said. Thats the doomsday scenario.  Regardless of his future actions, Obamas detente with Cuba and Iran will likely tarnish his legacy forever, Dorrinson said.

58,Real,"Trump wins Electoral College vote as insurgency fizzles WASHINGTON  Donald Trump will  officially  become president next month.  Trump surpassed the 270 electoral votes needed from 538 electors casting their ballots, in a day of normally ceremonial voting that drew attention amid intense social media pressure and protests in state capitols.  Despite a last-minute push by outside progressive and Libertarian groups, there was no rebellion. In fact, most of the ""faithless"" electors appeared to be Hillary Clinton defectors in Washington state, with three voting for former secretary of State Colin Powell and one for Faith Spotted Eagle, a Native American an environmental activist. Two Texas GOP electors went rogue and didn't vote for Trump.  The meetings, which occur more than a month after the Nov. 8 election, are typically a formality. This year, Trump critics mounted a vocal campaign appealing to the Republican electors pledged to vote for him. The official results of the vote will be announced before Congress on Jan. 6, although the results from each state were released throughout the day Monday.  Is this any way to choose a president? Only half of Americans think so GOP electors targeted with $500K ad buy in final anti-Trump push Aides: Critics trying to use Electoral College to de-legitimize Trump Electors received thousands of emails and phone calls arguing Trump is unqualified, as the first president in the nations history with no military or government experience and with potential conflicts of interest due to his business empire. Confirmation by the FBI and CIA that the Russian government hacked Clintons campaign and the Democratic National Committee seeking to help Trump win the election have amplified their calls.  Frankly, at this point, I'm wondering if Putin helped Trump win the Republican primary,"" Chris Suprun, a Texas elector who's been an outspoken critic, said before the voting began. In Rhode Island, electors passed a motion calling for an independent, bipartisan investigation into Russian intervention in the election as Congress debates whether the matter should be reviewed by Republican-led committees or as an independent probe.  Thousands of protesters gathered outside state capitals throughout the country. Yet in the end, the rebellion fell far short of the dozens of potential faithless electors that some Trump opponents said could materialize.   Opponents would have needed 37 GOP electors to switch their votes. The one alternative to Trump, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, had told electors not to vote for him. Even if there were a mass defection, the matter would have kicked to the Republican-led House of Representatives, which was unlikely to override their own partys president. Further, the Republican National Committee conducted a parallel whip effort to make sure electors stick to the plan to vote for Trump.  Clinton won more than 2.8 million more votes than Trump nationwide. But Trump won a majority of the 538 electoral votes  the state-by-state system created by the nation's founders based on the size of a states congressional delegation.  A short history lesson on presidents winning without the popular vote Its the second time in recent history, including Democrat Al Gores loss in 2000 to George W. Bush, that the person winning the popular vote lost the election. Before that, it hadnt been since 1888, when Benjamin Harrison beat Grover Cleveland, that a candidate won the presidency despite losing the popular vote.  The trend is causing Democrats to question the system by which the nation chooses its leaders, according to a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll. It finds 50% of registered voters believe the Electoral College should choose the president. Yet more than four in 10  42%  say the Constitution should be amended so the popular vote prevails in choosing the commander in chief. Liberals are most likely to want a change while conservatives want to keep the current system.  Trump assumes the mantle with an electorate deeply skeptical of his presidency, according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. While the percentage of voters who view him positively has increased to 41%, thats 7 points less than those who view him unfavorably. While 45% said they were optimistic and satisfied about Trump as president, its 21 points below Obamas number in January 2009 and 14 points below George W. Bushs number at the same time in 2000."

60,Real,"Donald Trumps doctor: If something happens to him, then it happens to him Donald Trump's campaign and its supporters spent a good portion of the 2016 campaign arguing that Hillary Clinton was secretly very ill and not up to the task of being president.  Trump's doctor, by contrast, isn't too worried about his patient dying in office  at least, not when it comes to the future of the country.  If something happens to him, then it happens to him, Harold Bornstein says. Its like all the rest of us, no? Thats why we have a vice president and a speaker of the House and a whole line of people.

And: Ronald Reagan had pre-senile dementia. I mean, seriously, did they share that one with you, or did Nancy just cover it up? Before agreeing to the interview, Bornstein pleaded for the reporter to leave him alone. Please stop this nonsense!!! he said in an email. On having second thoughts about the interview being published afterward: I happen to have known the Sulzbergers [the family that owns the New York Times] for 50 years. Im going to make sure you dont ever work again if you do this. Trump isn't an old man the way my grandfather was an old man. But Hillary Clinton: Shes an old lady. Shes an old lady. Its funny, isnt it? On his son volunteering to work for Trump's campaign: What a great experience, for an 18-year-old to go to Trump Tower in a presidential year, with this character, of all people. Bornstein, in case you haven't noticed, is kind of like Trump, if Trump were less rich and an eccentric gastroenterologist. Witness this anecdote:  The back of his business cards are written in Italian, with the phrase dottore molto famoso, or very famous doctor, below his name. (For 10 years, he took private Italian lessons from women he found through Craigslist postings, paying them about $60 an hour for weekly sessions, he said.) A photograph of his psychoanalyst hangs in his office. As this reporter left his office, Bornstein pointed out what appeared to be a small, naked doll sitting on the ground  heres a naked doorstop.

We interviewed the volunteers before we exposed them to the Republican candidates and afterward, said psychologist Davis Logsdon. The spike in their self-esteem was off the charts.  Of the candidates who most improved the research subjects sense of self, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush were found to be consistently helpful, but the most marked increase in self-esteem levels came after the subjects were exposed to Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. According to the data, people who viewed Walker for approximately three minutes reported feeling better right away about their intelligence, knowledge, and prospects for obtaining high-status employment that they had previously considered well beyond their reach.  After watching Governor Walker, a substantial number of the subjects literally could not remember why they had ever felt bad about themselves, Logsdon said.

64,Satire,"The 8th Amendment Meets the 5th Amendment Why cant we just take them out and shoot em? We know theyre guilty.  Because the guilt of the German leaders should be carefully documented. Because our system is not lynch law. We will dispense punishment as the evidence demands.  Joe Nocera in the New York Times quoting Harold Bursons scripts from the Nuremberg trials.  It happened because of prison overcrowding. Prison overcrowding creates unconstitutional conditions for inmates. Anything that can be done to relieve those unconstitutional conditions is welcome.  For those who have not paid much attention to prison overcrowding, the U.S. Supreme Court case of Brown v. Plata is an eye opener. Although it affects only the California prison system, it focuses attention on overcrowded conditions in state and federal prisons alike. Writing for the majority in that case, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said that California prisons were designed to house a population of 80,000 but that the population was close to double that. Prisoners he said, are crammed into spaces neither designed nor intended to house inmates... [S]uicidal inmates may be held for prolonged periods in telephone booth sized cages without toilets  and the lack of care results in needless suffering and death. Stating the often overlooked but obvious truism, Justice Kennedy says that even though incarcerated, Prisoners retain the essence of human dignity inherent in all persons. Respect for that dignity animates the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. He concludes his opinion saying that The medical and mental health care provided by Californias prisons falls below the standard of decency that inheres in the Eighth Amendment.  Overcrowding is a problem in federal prisons as well. According to The Crime Report, when the U.S. Attorney for Atlanta, Sally Quillian Yates, was testifying before the U.S. Sentencing Commission in Washington in late May 2010, she said that federal facilities are currently operating at 34 percent above capacity. In her testimony she said that the overcrowding will have real and detrimental consequences for the safety of prisoners. Her concerns are echoed by Bryan Lowry, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Council of Prison Locals. Testifying before a House Appropriations subcommittee in 2010 he pointed out to the committee that between June 2008 and the time of his testimony in March 2010, there were 340 inmate-on-staff assaults in federal prisons nationwide. He told the committee that These aggressive acts by inmates against staff illustrate a common reality facing staff daily at their workplace. Federal prisons have continued to be increasingly dangerous places to work, primarily because of serious correctional worker understaffing and prison inmate overcrowding problems. And that all serves to highlight what we learned from the Platt case. Overcrowding violates the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment that is proscribed by the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. It also helps explain the death of Anwar al-Awlaki, the United States citizen who was summarily executed by the United States Government because he had been designated a terrorist.  Mr. Awlaki was killed September 30 in Yemen by a missile fired from a United States operated drone aircraft. Mr. Awlaki spent the first seven years of his life in Las Cruces New Mexico. His family moved to Yemen where he lived until he was 19 when he returned to the United States to attend college. Following his graduation he became an Imam at assorted mosques in the United States. Eventually he became a fiery preacher advocating the mass murder of American citizens.  In early 2010 the U.S. government said his actions made him a justifiable target for capture or death. His father objected to the fact that his son had been made death penalty eligible without having been tried or convicted of any offense. Aided by the ACLU he went to court alleging that the actions of the government in authorizing his sons summary execution violated the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution. The judge threw out the lawsuit although he said that the actions of the government raised stark, and perplexing, questions one of which was whether the president could order the assassination of a U.S. citizen without first affording him any form of judicial process whatsoever, based [on] the mere assertion that he is a dangerous member of a terrorist organization. The question has now been answered. It can, it did and Mr. Awlaki is now dead.  In making its decision to kill Mr. Awlaki, it is clear that the Obama administration was addressing two competing interests. If Mr. Awlaki was captured and sent to prison his 5th Amendment due process rights would be preserved but the other prisoners 8th Amendment rights would be impinged by increasing the overcrowding. By killing him the administration was violating the constitutional rights of only one person instead of many. Examined in that light it is obvious that the government made the right decision. It should also cause the rest of the country to wonder how far the administration is willing to go to avoid further prison overcrowding. Time will tell."

Obama instructed his ambassador to the United Nations to abstain from a vote which drastically impacted one of our most staunch allies, Israel. A veto by the United States, which has been done in the past, would have prevented the U.N.

Very quietly, Obama also welcomed more than 2,000 new Muslim refugees onto American soil. These people, largely men, already had their asylum requests denied by the Australian government. They were being held in a detention facility when Obama decided the American taxpayers should begin paying for their resettlement  regardless of the risks to national security.  President Obama had heralded George W. Bushs commitment to a respectful transition and promised his distraught staff would adhere to the same level of professionalism and decorum. Instead, he led the charge to behave like a petulant spoiled child himself.  First, Michelle Obama sat down for a chat with Oprah Winfrey and claimed America is now without hope. Tens of millions of Americans are feeling hopeful for the first time in eight years, but those of us who live in flyover country or are part of blue collar communities or the middle class really dont matter to liberals.  Lashing out at Donald Trump because We the People chose him over a corrupt, lying career politician simply showcases how shallow and self-involved Barack Obama and his wife truly are. There is nothing Democrats in Congress can do to stop Trumps agenda from passingthanks to Harry Reids short-sighted pushing for the nuclear option.  Michael Moore and his horde of liberal followers will not be able to stop Trump from being sworn in on January 20  nor will they succeed in pushing his oath-taking ceremony inside. The efforts of #Disrupt20 protesters will fail just as surely as Jill Steins recount endeavors.  If Barack Obama wanted his legacy to involve appearing small, glib, and completely delusional, he has succeeded. He is now nothing more than a frustrating nuisance for President-Elect Donald Trump and the patriotic Americans who cast ballots in his favor. Soon Obama will finally be gone, and Trump can repeal his foolish liberal regulations and executive orders and put the nation back on the track to greatness and prosperity for ALL!"
67,Fake,"ASSASSINATION OF RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR JUSTIFIED, LIBERAL JOURNALIST SAYS A writer for the NY Daily News argued Tuesday that justice was served following the assassination of Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov. According to Gersh Kuntzman, the murder of Karlov at the hands of a Turkish police officer shouting, Allahu akbar, and, Dont forget Aleppo, was not terrorism, but instead a noble act. As Vladimir Putins man in Turkey, Karlov was the public face of that murderous dictators war crimes around the globe and of oppression at home, Kuntzman claims. Andrei Karlov is the human embodiment of policies that deployed bunker busters to kill babies, sent fighter planes on scorched earth bombing runs that destroyed a whole city, aided Syrian madman Bashar al-Assad in his campaign that has killed hundreds of thousands, and even ordered attacks on UN aid workers. Kuntzman, who was surprised his murder didnt come months ago, attempted to draw comparisons to the 1938 assassination of Ernst vom Rath, the Nazi ambassador to France. Like Karlov, Rath was the public face of atrocity  in this case, Adolf Hitlers genocide, anti-Semitism and coming global aggression, Kuntzman wrote, comparing Russias role in Syria to Hitlers across multiple continents. After receiving backlash for the controversial piece, Kuntzman further defended his position on social media, arguing that Karlov was a soldier  therefore shooting him in the back outside of a warzone was an appropriate move."

The mug, which portrays an angry man shouting a racist phrase, immediately drew the ire of Democrats, who said it sends exactly the wrong signal to a divided nation.  But Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway brushed off the criticism.  Democrats talk about healing our country, and yet this kind of talk does nothing to bring our country together, said Conway. President-elect Trump is very pleased to have the angry, racist coffee mug join his incredible team to make America great again, and I urge all Americans not to judge the angry, racist coffee mug on its past performance, on what we think its views are, or on any other forms of perceiving it, but instead judge it on what it will do in the unknowable future.  Other Republicans accused Democrats of attempting to undermine the incoming president.  They lost the election and now theyre pointing fingers trying to make the angry, racist coffee mug into a caricature, said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. I havent met the angry, racist coffee mug personally, so I cant say its racist or not, but I can say its ridiculous to claim that the angry, racist coffee mug is entirely responsible for every single thing thats printed on it.  Sources inside Trump Tower said the angry, racist coffee mug has so far fit seamlessly into the transition, and hinted that another staff announcement could come as early as tomorrow, when outgoing advisor Mike Rogers, a Republican moderate, will be replaced by a box of firecrackers."

The order, which makes a non-taxpayer ineligible to serve as President, goes into effect immediately.  Since the President has such a large say in how federal taxes are spent, it only makes sense that he or she contribute to those taxes, too, he said, noting that everyone who has served as President has been a taxpayer.  The President urged people not to read too much into the timing of his executive order. It just seemed like the right thing to do, he said.  Obamas action drew howls of protest from Republicans on Capitol Hill, including the House Speaker, Paul Ryan. This is nothing less than an attack on the American dream of paying no taxes, Ryan said.  The President, who brushed off that criticism, is reportedly readying another executive order requiring cabinet members to have held at least a summer job relevant to their posts."

They want action and its clear that the candidates who can successfully wrestle and defeat a bear are ready to wrestle the economy, foreign policy, and Barack Obama.  In tonights debate, televised live on CNN and Animal Planet, the eight Republican candidates will choose between Greco-Roman and freestyle human-bear wrestling; a lottery has already determined the ursine opponents, from a field including Grizzlies, Giant Pandas, and Asiatic Black Bears. Should the winner of each match actually be a bear, that bear will then be eligible to enter the Iowa Caucuses in February 2012, following appropriate periods of hibernation.  Washington insiders are unsure of what strategies the Republican candidates will bring to these matches, given their limited experience in bear wrestling. Aside from Rick Perry shooting a coyote, this really levels the playing field, says Republican strategist Pete Hallmeck. I have wrestled the bears of tax burdens and out-of-control government, Michele Bachmann told reporters earlier today. A real bear should not be a problem, whether its a Kodiak or a koala. When it was pointed out that a koala is not actually a real bear, Bachmann asked, What about Yogi Bear?

And since he has not released his tax returns, its impossible to verify how much money he has given to charity.  According to the Washington Post, Mr. Trump has given only one traceable personal donation since 2008 -- for $10,000, to the Police Athletic League of New York City. As for the Trump Foundation, Mr. Trump has given $5.5 million to the group since its inception -- but has not contributed to it since 2008, meaning the organization has largely been funded by other people in recent years.  In addition, several reports have established that Mr. Trump used money from the foundation to help further his political interests. The Washington Post reported, for example, that Mr. Trump used foundation funds to settle legal disputes -- and even to buy two large portraits of himself, one of which hung on the wall of a Trump-owned golf resort. He paid a $2,500 fine to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) earlier this year after it was revealed that his foundation made a $25,000 political contribution that violated tax laws.  The series of tweets came just two days after Mr. Trump announced he would be shuttering the foundation in the wake of questions about possible conflicts of interest.  Mr. Trump said in a Christmas Eve statement that he has directed his counsel to begin taking steps toward dissolving the foundation; however, it cannot formally shut down until the New York state attorney generals office completes its investigation of the foundation.  To avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways, Mr. Trump said in his statement.  Mr. Trumps tweets about the Trump Foundation also came just hours after he insisted on Twitter that there was no way President Obama could have beaten him in a hypothetical 2016 election between the two men, and criticized the United Nations for not living up to its great potential."

75,Real,"Senate Democrats plan to run their Trump playbook against Tillerson Congress is preparing to do major battle next month over President-elect Donald Trumps secretary-of-state nominee, Rex Tillerson, in a brewing proxy fight over Trumps potential financial conflicts of interest and his unconventional foreign policy.  The official sparring is expected to take place on Jan. 11, when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee plans to hold a two-part hearing to grill Tillerson over his tenure as ExxonMobils chief executive and what many lawmakers see as unseemly links to Russia.  But behind the scenes on Capitol Hill, the strategizing has already begun.  Democrats do not think they stand much chance of stopping Tillerson from being confirmed. But they plan to press the top diplomat-designate to commit to full divestiture from Exxon and detail how he would pursue a different approach to the world as secretary of state, in what one Senate Democratic aide who requested anonymity to candidly discuss strategy called a very thorough, tough vetting. As they have with Trump, Democrats plan to focus sharply on potential conflicts of interest deriving from Tillersons finances, as well as his views on critical foreign-policy matters.  Its a grilling they would happily give Trump, if only they had reason to drag him before a congressional committee.  Already, the minority party is railing against Republicans for refusing to demand Tillerson produce his tax returns. Their frustration stems from Tillersons response to a routine question about tax returns on the Foreign Relations Committees pre-hearing questionnaire. According to a Senate Democratic aide and a Trump transition team spokesman, Tillerson said he stood ready to provide only tax return information for himself and his wife for the previous three years. That means its possible Tillerson isnt willing to provide complete returns.   A battle is brewing over secretary of state-designate Rex Tillersons nomination on Capitol Hill. (Evan Vucci/AP) Democrats have demanded that all Trumps Cabinet nominees release their tax returns  something Trump himself steadfastly refused to do during the campaign, because, he said, the returns were under routine audit.  Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said the GOP would not break with years of precedent to compel Tillerson to turn over his tax returns without good reason, no matter how loud the clamor from Democrats. Unless there was a case where theres some irregularity thats known, the committee just does not ask for tax returns, Corker said in an interview.  Corker said Tillerson is not going to be the proxy [for Trump], because were not going to ask for tax returns.  I understand there are a number of Democrats who are very upset about President-elect Trump not putting his tax returns, Corker said. But thats not going to change the way we go about our committee process.  Senate Democrats believe they can fight miniature versions of the political battles they are waging with Trump during the confirmation hearings for his Cabinet choices  particularly those such as Tillerson who hail from the private sector. They intend to focus on Tillersons four-decade career at a major oil conglomerate and what they  and some Republicans  see as questionable ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Several Democratic members of the committee have said they also plan to ask Tillerson about human rights and climate change in light of his Exxon work.  Many lawmakers are leaning on Trump to fully divest from his companies because his wide-ranging business empire lends itself at the very least to an appearance of conflicts of interest. Democrats argue Tillersons business career raises similar questions.  Just how thorny those conflicts may be wont be clear until the committee receives Tillersons financial disclosure statements, documents that Corker expects to have before the end of 2016. Corker plans to give other committee members a copy of the disclosure as soon as we have it, providing ample time to review what is expected to be a very extensive document.  Committee Democrats are planning to scour Tillersons financials once they receive them and are exploring options to beef up their resources by borrowing tax and financial experts from other corners of the Hill or seconding Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department employees to help, according to an aide.  The all-in effort is vital, they argue, because unlike many previous secretaries of state, Tillerson has not had to publicize details about his personal finances. If confirmed, Tillerson would be the first secretary of state in decades who has not previously worked as a public servant or a member of the military.  This proposed nominee for secretary of state will likely be asked more questions than normal. Secretary Kerry was somebody that we knew. Secretary Clinton was somebody that we knew, Corker said. Since [Tillerson] will be up under the hood advising the president on foreign policy, a president who hasnt been involved in foreign policy in his business life, we certainly want to understand fully the kind of advice he would be giving the president as secretary of state.  Part of the logic behind planning a two-part hearing (one session in the morning and one in the afternoon), as Corker put it, is so there can be plenty, plenty, plenty of time for people to learn everything they want to from Tillerson.  A particular point of concern for Democrats and Republicans will be Tillersons relationship and business dealings with Putin, who awarded him the Kremlins Order of Friendship in 2013. Tillerson also opposed sanctions that the United States imposed on Russia in 2014 as a reaction to the annexation of Crimea and Moscows support of separatists in eastern Ukraine, arguing that Exxon lost $1 billion from the policy change.  On Thursday, Corker had a 30-minute conversation with Tillerson in which he questioned him about Russia, with the bulk of that conversation focusing on sanctions. He came away with the impression that Tillerson had no interest in ripping up existing sanctions on Russia, even if he criticized them as Exxons CEO.  That would be hugely problematic to this one senator, if I felt that was how we were going to begin the relations with Russia, Corker said, referring to himself. He noted the conversation alleviated some of the concerns he harbored about Tillersons relationship with the Kremlin.  Corker said he encouraged Tillerson to start calling other lawmakers on his committee. Tillerson and lead Foreign Relations Committee Democrat Ben Cardin (Md.) also spoke by phone Thursday, but a spokesman for Cardin would not detail what was discussed.  On Tuesday, Tillerson was in Washington, where he met with Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who endorsed his nomination. He hopes to meet with as many senators as possible to discuss his nomination, according to the Trump transition team.  I think, at least I hope, that when these meetings take place that were going to see a Rex Tillerson that has a standard view of Russias malicious activities, nefarious activities, Corker said. I got a good sense of how hed [approach] Russia and Putin, and it was certainly different, if you will, than the picture of him toasting Putin with champagne.  Several key GOP senators  including John McCain (Ariz.), Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and Marco Rubio (Fla.)  have expressed concerns that Tillersons ties to Russia could be a dangerous echo of Trumps seeming affinity for Putin. Those concerns have taken on even more urgency in wake of CIA allegations that Russia attempted to tilt the election to Trump.  Since the president-elect selected Tillerson, Trumps transition team has been rolling out foreign policy heavyweights such as Bob Gates, Condoleezza Rice, Stephen Hadley and Dick Cheney to vouch for Tillersons global bona fides. Gates, Rice and Hadley run a consulting firm that has Exxon is a client.  Only one Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee  Rubio  has publicly criticized Tillerson over his Kremlin ties, and he communicated those concerns directly to Corker before the nomination was formally announced.  Democrats need only persuade one Republican to oppose Tillerson to block his nomination in committee. But it is still possible he could get to a floor vote even if the committee rejects him. In the past, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has reported out nominations unfavorably, a procedure that expresses the members discontent without blocking the full Senate from voting. In 1983, the full Senate confirmed President Ronald Reagans Arms Control and Disarmament Agency nominee, Kenneth Adelman, despite his rejection by the panel.  But Corker expressed confidence that Tillerson would pass the committees test, even if his track record as an oil-company CEO gives members pause.  My sense is, based on the conversation we had, hes going to very much understand that his job now is to pursue our countrys national interest, Corker said."
76,Real,"Obamacare Has Its Biggest Day as Republicans Promise Repeal A record number of Americans signed up for Obamacare Thursday on what they thought would be the last day to enroll in health insurance coverage that starts in the new year, President Barack Obama said Friday.  So many people visited the federal government website that the administration extended the deadline until early next week to give more people time to sign up for what could be the last year of Obamacare coverage.  The Republicans who will control Congress and the White House starting next month say they'll repeal the law that provides the insurance markets as soon as they can  although there's no clear plan for how, when or what to put in its place.  Obama plugged the health insurance marketplace, the centerpiece of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, in his last press conference of the year before heading to Hawaii for vacation.  ""Yesterday was the biggest day ever for Healthcare.gov. More than 670,000 Americans signed up to get coverage,"" Obama said.  ""SINCE I SIGNED OBAMACARE INTO LAW, OUR BUSINESSES HAVE ADDED MORE THAN 15 MILLION NEW JOBS."" That's compared to 600,000 sign-ups last year on the Dec. 15 deadline.  Obama said when he took office, 44 million Americans lacked health insurance. ""Today, we have covered more than 20 million of them,"" he said. ""For the first time in history, more than 90 percent of Americans are insured.""  Republican opponents of Obamacare don't dispute the coverage numbers but say the law has failed to bring down costs for consumers, as had been promised.  Related: Most Americans Don't Want Obamacare Repealed  Premiums have risen as insurance companies taking part in the exchanges have struggled to make the profits they seek given the other restrictions imposed by the law. Obamacare limits the ability to charge higher premiums for women and older people, and it forces insurers to take all comers, even people who are already sick.  But the publicity over higher premiums didn't seem to scare off new customers. The Department of Health and Human Services said more than 4 million people have signed up for coverage on Healthcare.gov, compared to about 2.8 million enrollments by the first week of December last year. That includes 1.1 million people not covered before and 2.9 million renewals.  ""YESTERDAY WAS BIGGEST DAY EVER FOR HEALTHCARE.GOV. MORE THAN 670,000 AMERICANS SIGNED UP TO GET COVERAGE."" Most people who buy private insurance on the health insurance marketplaces get a hefty federal subsidy to help pay the premiums. An analysis by the Center for Health and Economy found those subsidies would cost $42.6 billion next year, an increase of nearly $10 billion over this year.  Related: Obamacare Repeal Would Take Insurance from 30 Million People  The enrollment numbers do not include 12 health insurance marketplaces run by states and Washington, D.C. independently of the federal government.  The new demand could help improve profitability for insurers, said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. ""If the current (Affordable Care Act) open enrollment period is successful and enrollment grows, it means the insurance market is not collapsing,"" he said via Twitter.  ""Because of the extraordinary demand, we extended the deadline to sign-up for January 1 coverage by two business days until 11:59 pm PST December 19. We don't yet know how many people will take advantage of this extension, but nearly a million consumers left their contact information to hold their place in line,"" HHS said in a statement.  Obama on Friday took a shot at critics who said the law would hurt business and employment by requiring larger employers to cover their workers.  ""Since I signed Obamacare into law, our businesses have added more than 15 million new jobs,"" he said."

This is a simple misunderstanding, one that Im sure happens to many Canadians, explained Eaton told the press while attending a fundraiser gala for slightly less wealthy children. I dont recall ever being told I was an Officer of Parliament. I know this Harper fellow vaguely, and I thought I was signing up for one of those European cruises on Parliament Hill. I really leave that appointment business to my accountants and lawyers.  Eaton claims that it was her close friend from her fine-art collecting club, simply known as Muffy, who submitted her name to the Prime Ministers Officer for a position in the Upper Chamber.  Somehow she placed my name on these Senate documents at the ceremony and took the oath for me. I had absolutely no idea what the devil she was signing me up for. I thought she was adding another Van Gogh for my collection.  The Harper-appointed Senator, most famous for demanding the audit of environmental charities, calling Canadas national symbol a dentally defective rat, and attempting to frame Roger Rabbit, promptly reported to Senate Ethics Commissioner Mary Dawson that she was oblivious to the fact that the debates and committees she attended over the last seven years had anything to do with the Senate.  I thought I was at the bridge club, it was so dull there. Fortunately, we only had to sit for half the year.

78,Real,"Trump picks budget 'hawk' Mick Mulvaney to lead budget office President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Mick Mulvaney, a conservative Republican congressman from South Carolina who is known as a budget hawk, as director of the Office of Management and Budget.  In a statement issued on Saturday morning  shortly after Trump tweeted an inflammatory comment about Chinas seizure of a US navy drone in the South China Sea  Trump called Mulvaney a very high-energy leader with deep convictions for how to responsibly manage our nations finances and save our country from drowning in red ink.  Trump also said that with Mulvaney as his budget director, his administration would make smart choices and renew the American taxpayers trust in how their money is spent.  Mulvaney said he would help restore budgetary and fiscal sanity  after eight years of an out-of-control, tax-and-spend financial agenda under Barack Obama.  Like other Trump nominations, the budget directors job requires Senate approval.  Mulvaneys nomination follows a pattern of Trump turning to individuals with records apparently hostile to the agencies they are nominated to lead.  For example, the Oklahoma attorney general, Scott Pruitt, a leading critic of climate change theories, has been nominated to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.  In other such moves, the billionaire and charter schools advocate Betsy DeVos has been nominated as education secretary and the Alabama senator Jeff Sessions, a critic of voting rights legislation, has been nominated as attorney general.  The announcement about Mulvaney was made as Trump, who takes office on 20 January, began his holiday vacation at Mar-a-Lago, his oceanfront club in Palm Beach, Florida.  Mulvaney, 49, was an outspoken critic of the former House speaker John Boehner, who resigned in 2015 amid opposition from fellow Republicans who were members of the House Freedom Caucus.  His selection points to a strategy by Trump to cut government where he can. The president-elect has recently railed against what he has called a far too expensive new version of the Air Force One aircraft he will use, which Boeing is supposed to build.  With Mick at the head of OMB, Trump said in his statement, my administration is going to make smart choices about Americas budget, bring new accountability to our federal government, and renew the American taxpayers trust in how their money is spent.  Mulvaney said: Each day, families across our nation make disciplined choices about how to spend their hard-earned money, and the federal government should exercise the same discretion that hard-working Americans do every day, he said.  On Friday night, Trump vowed to seek approval from Congress for $1tn in new spending to rebuild the countrys crumbling network of roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure as a way to create jobs and make some needed repairs.  We are going to fix our country. Its time. We have no choice. Its time, Trump said at a rally in Orlando, Florida."

Putin will be the most visible Trump surrogate in the final weekend of the campaign, as he tries to fire up voters in Florida, North Carolina, Colorado, and Nevada.  The Russian President seemed to relish the warm response he got at his first Trump rally, in Tampa, where he led the crowd in a raucous chant of Lock her up.  Trump praised Putins talent for politics by noting that he had won the Russian election in 2012 by a landslide. He got sixty-four per cent of the vote, and no one else even came close, Trump said. Hes terrific.  Putin, whose English is rudimentary at best, kept his remarks brief at the Tampa rally, but echoed Melania Trumps recent call for an end to bullying.  A Republican strategist, Harland Dorrinson, called the Trump campaigns use of Putin in crucial battleground states very, very smart.  At this point, you really couldnt ask for a more effective surrogate, he said. Youd much rather see Trump up there with Putin than with, say, Chris Christie.  While some in the media criticized the Trump campaign for allowing Putin to influence the outcome of a U.S. election, the Republican nominees campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, pushed back in an appearance on CNN.  This is just another case of media bias against Donald Trump, she said.

George Ellard, the NSAs inspector general, was placed on administrative leave after he refused to give the whistleblower a certain job assignment. The Project on Government Oversight, an advocacy group, first reported last week that Adm. Mike Rogers, director of NSA, had placed Ellard on leave and recommended that he be terminated. Ellard is appealing that decision.  Ellard received attention in 2014 for remarks at Georgetown University Law Center criticizing Snowden, the former NSA contractor who had leaked secret documents about the surveillance program. Snowden says he went public because he feared retaliation from his superiors if he had raised his concerns with them. Ellard said at Georgetown that Snowden could have safely come to him.  Ellards case is the first to move completely through a process created by President Barack Obama in 2012 to ensure that intelligence employees can effectively report waste, fraud and abuse while protecting classified information. The directive prohibits agencies from retaliating against them or taking away security clearances or an employees access to classified information.  The case stemmed from a whistleblowers claims of financial misconduct by NSA officials involving a conference in Nashville, Tennessee.  The whistleblower, in a brief email to The Associated Press, said that after he raised his concerns, his name was disclosed to Ellard in violation of rules intended to protect government employees who want to report misconduct.  The whistleblower said his email response had been cleared by the NSA. The agency declined to comment independently on the case. Ellards attorney did not respond to requests for comment.  Its not clear who revealed the whistleblowers identity to Ellard. But the whistleblower said that after Ellard learned who he was, I was denied an assignment within the NSA inspector generals office of investigations because of my whistleblowing. He sent the email to the AP on condition of anonymity because the case is still active.  Rogers decision to recommend Ellards dismissal followed an eight-month investigation by a panel of inspectors general at the CIA, Treasury and Justice Department, according to an intelligence official, who was not authorized to disclose details about the case and spoke on condition of anonymity. The trio was empaneled in October 2015 and issued its decision in May.  The Justice and Defense departments declined to comment on the decision.  Louis Clark, director of the Government Accountability Project, said he was happy that the process set up by Obamas directive was finally being used, but expressed disappointment that it has taken so long for it to happen. It was so slow because the intelligence agencies are extremely hostile to whistleblowing, he said.  The fate of Obamas directive is uncertain. It will be up to Donald Trump, after he becomes president, to decide whether to continue it. Trump has said he doesnt trust the intelligence agencies, but its not clear if that would make him more or less likely to protect whistleblowers.  Timothy Edgar, Obamas first director of privacy and civil liberties for the White House national security staff, says there is cause for serious concern about the future of whistleblowers.  What were left with, I think, is probably primarily the integrity and bravery of people in the bureaucracy, who, despite those obstacles are willing to say no if they are involved in activities that they think are serious violations of the Constitution, Edgar said."
81,Fake,"HILLARYS POPULAR VOTE WIN CAME ENTIRELY FROM CALIFORNIA Since Donald Trumps electoral victory, supporters of presidential loser Hillary Clinton have cried foul after their candidate won the popular vote, yet failed to win. On November 8, Trump was elected US president when he surpassed 270 electoral college votes. Clinton didnt come close to winning the electoral college  232 to Trumps 304  but she did succeed in securing the popular vote, by about 2.8 million people. But, If you take California out of the popular vote equation, then Trump wins the rest of the country by 1.4 million votes, reports Investors Business Daily. And if California voted like every other Democratic state  where Clinton averaged 53.5% wins  Clinton and Trump end up in a virtual popular vote tie. According to Investors, Trump easily won the presidency by every other metric even when California is included: Number of states won: Trump: 30 Clinton: 20 _________________ Trump: +10 Number of electoral votes won: Trump: 306 Clinton: 232 _________________ Trump: + 68 Ave. margin of victory in winning states: Trump: 56% Clinton: 53.5% _________________ Trump: + 2.5 points Popular vote total: Trump: 62,958,211 Clinton: 65,818,318 _________________ Clinton: + 2.8 million Popular vote total outside California: Trump: 58,474,401 Clinton: 57,064,530 _________________ Trump: + 1.4 million After clamoring that Trump would not accept the election results, butt-hurt Democrats have tried various tactics to steal and delegitimize his presidential victory, from calling for an end to the electoral college system, to implementing vote recounts  which backfired  to claiming the FBI rigged the election, to blaming fake news, a cartoon frog, Wikileaks, the alt-right and the Russian government."

The Onion looks at several of these promises and evaluates whether Trump will be willing or able to follow through on them.  Scrap The Iran Nuclear Deal: Most experts have warned that such a measure would be an incredibly short-sighted and dangerous move, so its pretty much a given  Repeal And Replace Obamacare: This is well within reach, as Trump has congressional support to repeal Obamacare and is poised to easily replace it with utter chaos  Imprison Hillary Clinton: Although hes walked back this promise in recent weeks, Americans are ready for this argument to reenter the national dialogue as soon as Trump needs to deflect attention from a devastating misstep or calamitous scandal  Eliminate Hanger Steak From The Menu: Trump is already throwing the full weight of his office behind removing this lesser cut of beef from all domestic restaurant offerings  Bring Jobs Back From China: Its unlikely that Trump will allow foreign jobs to come into the country under his strict immigration policy  Create A Muslim Registry: Instead of bullying the Muslim-American community by following through on this specific campaign promise, Trump will likely find it much more effective to just let it hang over their heads indefinitely  Make Mexico Pay For Border Wall: Look, he said hes gonna do it, and hes gonna do it, okay?

Launched in 2010 with a mission to combat childhood obesity by promoting exercise and improving access to healthier food choices for children in underserved communities, Let's Move has failed to achieve any of its goals, the president-elect claims.  ""It's a total disaster. A complete joke. Kids today are fatter than ever,"" Trump said. ""Maybe vegetables make you fat. Who knows? We're going to look into it.""  Trump indicated his administration would replace the campaign with one that promotes jobs and economic growth.  ""These kids don't need to play, they need jobs. Nobody's going to pay anyone to play hopscotch,"" he remarked. ""And not only is working a great form of exercise, it will help their parents pay the bills.""  Trump went on to say that he would work with Congress to have the provisions regulating child labor removed from the Fair Labor Standards Act, or simply repeal the entire law altogether in order to make way for his Get to Work initiative."
84,Fake,"URGENT: The Mainstream Media Was Hiding One HUGE Fact About Trump Win! Yall are gonna get a REAL kick outta this one. So remember how the Mainstream Media wouldnt shut up about Hillary Clinton beating Donald Trump in the popular vote by 2.8 Million? Well, that is technically true, but they left out one MAJOR fact  IF YOU DISCOUNT CALIFORNIA AND NEW YORK, DONALD TRUMP BEAT HILLARY CLINTON BY MORE THAN 3 MILLION VOTES IN THE OTHER STATES!!    You see, Hillary Clinton managed to win the classic blue states (both of which have massive sanctuary cities) by 4.2 million in California and 1.8 million in New York.  In fact, by those numbers, it is safe to say that California alone is the ENTIRE reason Clinton won the popular vote and California does NOT speak for the entire country.  This is exactly why the electoral college exists, though. These 2 states do not account for the entire nation. They know NOTHING about the problems in places like Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Florida, all of which voted Trump. (H/T  Daily Mail)  Newt Gingrich brilliantly stated,  THIS IS FOOTBALL SEASON. A TEAM CAN HAVE MORE YARDS AND LOSE THE GAME. WHAT MATTERS IS HOW MANY POINTS YOU PUT ON THE BOARD.

85,Real,"Obama Designates Atlantic, Arctic Areas Off-Limits To Offshore Drilling President Obama has indefinitely blocked offshore drilling in areas of the Atlantic Ocean and in Arctic waters, a move aimed at advancing environmental protection during his final days in office.  The Arctic protections are a joint partnership with Canada. ""These actions, and Canada's parallel actions, protect a sensitive and unique ecosystem that is unlike any other region on earth,"" the White House said in a statement.  ""They reflect the scientific assessment that, even with the high safety standards that both our countries have put in place, the risks of an oil spill in this region are significant and our ability to clean up from a spill in the region's harsh conditions is limited,"" the White House added. ""By contrast, it would take decades to fully develop the production infrastructure necessary for any large-scale oil and gas leasing production in the region  at a time when we need to continue to move decisively away from fossil fuels.""   This map shows the Atlantic areas that have been designated off limits to oil and gas explorations and development activity. White House Obama's action designates 31 Atlantic canyons ""off limits to oil and gas exploration and development activity,"" totaling 3.8 million acres, according to the administration. It provides the same protections to much of the Arctic's waters, covering the ""vast majority of U.S. waters in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas,"" totaling 115 million acres. Canada is doing the same to ""all Arctic Canadian waters,"" the joint statement adds.  Obama took these actions by invoking a law called the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which gives the president the authority to withdraw lands from oil and gas leases. But as NPR's Jeff Brady and Jennifer Ludden report, major questions remain about what will happen if the incoming Trump administration attempts to reverse this action.  ""The White House says the president is acting within his authority, that Presidents of both parties have done this in the past, and trying to reverse such an order would be unprecedented if Trump tried to do this,"" Jeff said on All Things Considered.  There is no legal precedent for reversal, Jeff reports. ""So if there's a legal challenge, and I'm not going to be surprised if there is one, it's really not clear what a court would decide.""   This map shows the area that the U.S. has designated as indefinitely off limits to offshore oil and gas leasing. White House As Bloomberg reports, the ""statute doesn't include a provision for reversal and that action may take years to work its way through court.""  Environmental groups such as Oceana are celebrating the designation. ""President Obama has taken a key step in protecting important areas of the Atlantic Ocean from offshore drilling,"" as Jacqueline Savitz, the group's senior vice president for the United States, said in a statement. ""The people of the Atlantic coast refused to allow their way of life to be compromised and we commend their hard work making their voices heard in Washington.""  Representatives of the oil and gas industry are unhappy about the news. ""We think it's a very short-sighted decision to take these areas off limits,"" Andy Radford, senior policy advisor for offshore issues at the American Petroleum Institute, told Jeff the action poses ""great risk to our energy security going forward and eliminates the opportunity to create jobs and help small businesses throughout the country. ""  Earlier this year, the Obama administration reversed course on a plan that would have allowed Atlantic offshore drilling after uproar from local communities and environmentalists.  Then, the administration designated the first national marine monument in the Atlantic Ocean. Last week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that it has protected an Atlantic area about the size of New Jersey from deep-sea commercial fishing."
86,Real,"Trump protesters plan to open 'movement house' in Washington DC A group of millennial activists from across the country plan to open a movement house in Washington DC next month, which will serve as a permanent base to protest Donald Trumps presidency.  The organizers are mostly women of color, many of whom campaigned for Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primary.  The house, which will be set up by inauguration day on 20 January, has been dubbed District 13, in a reference to a rebellious neighborhood in the Hunger Games books and films.  Activists told the Guardian that it will serve as a space for the best kinds of troublemakers from around the country. The property will be located in Capitol Hill, close to the White House and the Capitol building, and will enable activists to quickly mobilize against Trump should he court controversy during his presidency.   Ripples of a revolution: what will Bernie Sanders' supporters do next? Read more Ultimately its to make sure we hold him accountable, said Moumita Ahmed, the founder of Millennials for Revolution, a group which span off from the Bernie Sanders-supporting Millennials for Bernie.  Because his presidency is not normal at all. Its our duty to make sure he doesnt succeed.  If he succeeds its a message that everything he stood for is OK. That its OK to get to power in the way that he did, and hurt all the people hes hurt.  District 13 will be open to activist groups around the country who wish to demonstrate in the capital, Ahmed said. The house is inspired by movement houses from the civil rights era, which served as a safe haven for people to plan marches and protests.  People from ethnic-minority activist groups, such as African Americans for Bernie and Color of Change, are involved in planning for the movement house, while climate change and minimum wage campaigners have also contributed.  Most of the people involved are people who will most definitely be affected by this administration, Ahmed said.  As someone who is from a Muslim family, Im invested in the safety of my community. And I see this administration as a threat to my community, especially because of the rhetoric that was used to become the president.  The groups launched a crowdfunding effort on Tuesday to support District 13. They aim to reach $50,000, which will cover the houses rent for one year.  Erika Peralta, who has worked for Color of Change  an organization with more than one million members that works to create a more human and less hostile world for black people in America  is another organizer of District 13. She plans to live in the house for the first three months of Trumps presidency.  The aim is to be a focal point and a nexus for activists and progressive people across the country to provide them resources and aid and our networks to stop any hatred that may come from the White House or to stand up against it, Peralta said.  Were going to work to make sure that whatever [Trump] is trying to do, whether its a Muslim registry or deport a bunch of immigrants, were not going to let that happen."
87,Real,"Newt Gingrich says Trump is done with drain the swamp There were two notable Trumpworld headlines Wednesday morning. One was the news that Corey Lewandowski  Donald Trump's former campaign manager who remained part of his inner circle long after leaving that job  had just opened a full service government relations and consulting firm half a block from the White House.  The other was that the president-elect is apparently over drain the swamp.  That's according to Newt Gingrich, a top ally who told NPR in an interview that aired Wednesday morning that he was instructed not to use the phrase anymore because it has fallen out of favor with Trump.  I'm told he now just disclaims that, Gingrich said on Morning Edition. He now says it was cute, but he doesn't want to use it anymore.  Gingrich said he had written what I thought was a very cute tweet about 'the alligators are complaining,'"" but that somebody wrote back and said they were tired of hearing this stuff.  Gingrich actually drafted two tweets in recent days about draining the swamp  tweets that apparently earned him the rebuke.   But this should really come as no surprise. Trump himself has acknowledged his on-again, off-again relationship with the phrase. And it actually wasn't a mainstay in the campaign until the final days.  Trump freely admitted that he never much liked the phrase, in fact. But he said that his crowds had prevailed upon him to embrace it.  ""'Drain the swamp.' We put it in about two days ago. I said, 'Drain the swamp.' I didn't like it. I didn't like the expression: 'Drain the swamp in Washington,'"" Trump said Oct. 26 at a rally in North Carolina. So I said it three days ago; the place went crazy. I said, 'You know what? I'm starting to like that expression.' And now it's a hot  it's like trending all over the world.  Trump explains why he didnt like the phrase drain the swamp but now does  Play Video0:39 At a rally in Kinston, N.C., Oct. 26, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump said the phrase drain the swamp had been trending all over the world since he started using it. (The Washington Post) As admissions of political expediency go, this is pretty forthcoming.  But it's also worth noting here that Trump's flip on this phrase seems to have come pretty suddenly. Just a day before Gingrich's first tweet above, Trump promised in Alabama to drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C. He said the same in Orlando the day before and in Hershey, Pa., the day before that.  So it's not clear whether a specific story or cable news item  which have a tendency to draw instant Trump policy directives and declarations  might have influenced this change of course, if indeed it sticks. But what's clear is that Trump's efforts to drain the swamp have increasingly been derided and scoffed at as he has named a Goldman Sachs executive to head the Treasury Department and politicians and fellow billionaires to lead other departments. And then there are the many possible conflicts of interest.  Saturday Night Live a couple weeks back featured this well-written exchange:  5-Minute Fix newsletter Keeping up with politics is easy now.

KATE MCKINNON-AS-KELLYANNE CONWAY: Don't you mean drain the swamp and build the wall?  BALDWIN-AS-TRUMP: No, that's too many things. Just smush them together.  The sketch earned an immediate rebuke from Trump. It's not clear whether he objected to this particular passage  his visage was compared in the sketch to a plate of mashed potatoes, after all  but you can bet Trump has noticed the derisive coverage of his pledge to drain the swamp.

And given that he never really liked the phrase, it should be no surprise he might be willing to drop it like a bad habit."

Trump was still stinging from having lost an Emmy for The Celebrity Apprentice, the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences offered to give the former reality-show host a belated Emmy if he will drop out of the 2016 race.  We never imagined that if we had simply given you an Emmy back in the day our current national nightmare might have been avoided, a Television Academy spokesman said in an online video.  Displaying an Emmy statuette, the spokesman said, Heres your Emmy, Mr. Trump, all gold and shiny, just the way you like things to be.  Reached by reporters, the spokesman said that the Academy decided to give Trump the belated Emmy because the organization felt terrible about the unwitting role it had played in bringing the United States to the brink of destruction.

Bill Clinton stated that Trump knows how to get angry, white men to vote for him, and Trump responded by saying that Hillary Clintons campaign focused too much on the wrong states, as per Fox News.  Hillarys husband and the rest of the Democrats are pointing fingers everywhere except for at Hillary Clinton, who deserves it.  The fact of the matter is that she ran a terrible campaign, and thats why she lost. You would think she would have done so much better, due to the fact that this wasnt her first rodeo, but it bombed. It was DOA. Dead. On. Arrival.  Regarding Bills statement that Trump called him after the election, Trump clarified that it was Bill Clinton who called him and offered a very nice congratulations. Donald Trump was elected because he ran a very successful, if unconventional, campaign.  It was because of its unconventionality that it was so successful. The Trump campaign was a breath of fresh air to the American people, who were tired of the same old rickety career politicians who are dusted off and paraded around for the people to see.  Hillarys campaign did focus on the wrong states and barely made any appearances. Donald Trump hopped from state to state, practically killing himself to make several appearances and running himself ragged to prove to the people he was their best choice.  She failed to focus on states like Arkansas and states in the Midwest. She probably viewed them as beneath her and not worth her precious time. She was so sure that she was going to win that she didnt even bother trying to sell herself in enough states.  The Clintons lost because of her and her campaigns mistakes, but who do they blame? They blame people like FBI Director Comey for reopening the investigation into Hillarys email scandal 11 days before the election, which did hurt her numbers.  But frankly, if youre going to complain about that, then try not performing illicit actions with government property and maybe you wont be in the situation in the first place. Its as simple as that, but the Democrats refuse to not think of themselves as victims.  Donald Trumps response to Bill Clinton was absolutely perfect, and even more so because he put it on Twitter and sent it directly to the American people. Trump doesnt wait for the mainstream media to twist his wordshe delivers them himself.  Trump is our president-elect, and he was confirmed as the next president by the Electoral College on Monday. So, all the effort that liberals put forth to prevent this was for nothingthey have, once again, failed. They can point fingers all they want and play the blame game, but it wont change the outcome that Trump is the president, and Hillary Clinton is not."

92,Real,"Goldman executive Gary Cohn tapped for White House economic post  report President-elect Donald Trump has asked Goldman Sachs executive Gary Cohn to head his White House national economic council, a group that coordinates economic policy across agencies, NBC News reported on Friday.  If elected, Cohn would be the third Goldman alumni picked to serve in the Trump administration: Steven Mnuchin, nominated to head the treasury department, and Steve Bannon, picked to be White House chief strategist, are both ex-Goldman Sachs executives.  Cohn, 56, is president and chief operating officer at the Wall Street firm and had until recently been widely considered the heir apparent to chief executive Lloyd Blankfein. But according to the Wall Street Journal, Cohn, who met with Trump on Tuesday, has been considering a move in recent months.  Analysis Trump's billionaire cabinet could be the wealthiest administration ever Opponents warn the administration is set to be packed with tycoons who will do nothing to fulfil his promise of helping working-class Americans  A Goldman Sachs spokesman was not immediately available for comment.  Cohn is a former Goldman commodities trader from Ohio who joined the firm in 1990. He served in a variety of leadership roles in bond trading, becoming co-head of Goldmans broader securities and, eventually, co-president in 2006. He makes frequent appearances at industry conferences and on television, speaking on the state of the financial markets.  Cohn is a registered Democrat who has donated money to both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.  If he takes the post, he will be following in the footsteps of Robert Rubin and Stephen Friedman, two other onetime Goldman Sachs executives who served in that role. "

96,Real,"N.Y. attorney general's office: Trump can't shut down foundation until investigation ends WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Donald Trump cannot move ahead with his plan to dismantle his charitable foundation because state prosecutors are probing whether the president-elect personally benefited from its spending, the New York attorney generals office said Tuesday.  The Trump foundation is still under investigation by this office and cannot legally dissolve until that investigation is complete, said Amy Spitalnick, spokeswoman for state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.  The statement came after Trump announced that he wanted to dissolve the Donald J. Trump Foundation, part of what his presidential transition team says is an effort to erase any potential conflicts of interest before he takes office Jan. 20.  But the foundations inner workings have been the subject of Schneidermans investigation for months and could remain a thorny issue for Trumps incoming administration. Democrats nationally have said they are ready to raise any legal or ethical issues from Trumps global business empire during his presidency.  Trumps charity has admitted that it violated IRS regulations barring it from using its money or assets to benefit Trump, his family, his companies or substantial contributors to the foundation.  President-elect announces he will shutter Trump Foundation The admissions by the Donald J. Trump Foundation were in a 2015 tax filing made public after a presidential election in which it was revealed that Trump has used the charity to settle lawsuits, make a $25,000 political contribution and purchase items, such as a painting of himself, that was displayed at one of his properties.  The 2015 tax filing was posted on the nonprofit monitoring website GuideStar on Nov. 18 by someone using an email address from the foundations law firm, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, said GuideStar spokeswoman Jackie Enterline Fekeci.  In the tax filing, the foundation acknowledged that it used money or assets in violation of the regulations not only during 2015, but in prior years. But the tax filing doesnt provide details on the violations.  Schneiderman, a Democrat, launched his investigation into the charity after reporting by The Washington Post drew attention to some of the foundations purchases.  Trump asserted on Twitter late Monday that his foundation was run efficiently.  The DJT Foundation, unlike most foundations, never paid fees, rent, salaries or any expenses, the president-elect tweeted. 100% of the money goes to wonderful charities."

104,Fake,"Just Days Before Leaving Office, Obama Gets News that Could INVALIDATE His Entire Presidency President Barack Obamas legacy might soon be tarnished beyond repair. The long-awaited results from an in-depth investigation into Obamas past have just been revealed.  Barack Obamas birth certificate is a fake a complete forgery, and now evidence to prove it is headed to Congress. Arizona Sheriff Joe Apraios investigation into Obamas birth certificate found multiple inconsistencies, which could allow Congress to impeach the 44th president of the United States even after he leaves office, WND reports.  The forensic investigation into Obamas birth certificate reportedly proves the birthers were right all along! Jerome Corsi, Ph.D., a WND senior staff writer, is credited with forcing the Obama administration to release the document in the first place.  Corsis book, Wheres The Birth Certificate?, first brought the Obama birth certificate issue to the publics attention. The Constitution requires a presidential candidate to be a natural-born citizen but does not really define exactly what the entails  meaning even though Obama was born to an American woman, he still might not have qualified to run for the highest office in the land.  I was raised as an Indonesian child and a Hawaiian child and as a black child and as a white child, Obama once said, according to a report by the Miller Center. Obama spent four years of his childhood living in Indonesia with his mother and stepfather.  Sheriff Joe Apraios forensic investigation into Obamas birth certificate revealed the document presented to the public appears to be identical to and copied from another birth certificate issued in Hawaii just several days after he was born. The exceedingly similar birth certificate reportedly belongs to Johanna Ahnee.  The items on the supposed Obama birth certificate, which appear to have been copied from the Johanna Ahnee birth certificate, include the word Honolulu, the word Oahu twice, two time stamps, and three different Xs. The identical appearance of the Xs was reportedly of particular interest to forensic investigators.  The Xs would have been placed on the original birth certificate documents by moving a typewriter carriage and rolling over the certificate at the same time. Investigators reportedly found it interesting that the stamp made by Alvin Onaka and the April 25th stamp might have been lifted from another document.  One of the expert forensic investigators who participated in the review of the Obama birth certificate was Reed Hayes. He is a court-qualified document examiner and handwriting examiner.  Reed Hayes also operates a business in Hawaii. He has been on the board of Scientific Association of Forensic Examiners for almost four decades. Forlabs, an Italian company which specializes in extracting details and information from multimedia files, produced the results of the Obama birth certificate forensic investigation.  We had two experts from two countries in separate disciplines of forensics that came to one conclusion: Barack Obamas long form birth certificate it not authentic, the report said.  Mike Zullo, the lead forensic investigator involved with the report, quoted details from the investigation by Hayes: The (nail in the coffin) that proves that Certificate of Live Birth is inauthentic is the exact lineup of numerous entries on both [certificates]. Zullo added the experts likened the evidence they found to prove the Obama birth certificate is a forgery to being as reliable as a fingerprint."

106,Real,"Trump's choice for education secretary raises fears in Detroit Two years ago, Jonathan Clark was sending his four school-age kids to four different schools in Detroit.  We were driving 200 miles a week just to and from school, he said. His three oldest  all girls, ages 14 to 16  were enrolled at charters, privately run schools funded by the government that promise better educational outcomes.  Clark was able to send his kids to schools all over the city because of school choice, the policy that allows kids to get educated outside their home district. But Clark said the conditions at these charter schools were no different from whats typical of a public school in Detroit: a lack of resources needed to educate students, high teacher turnover, and low test scores.  These are all things they give bad marks to DPS [Detroit public schools] on, he said, but charters are doing the same.  Analysis Trump's cabinet looks increasingly conventional but far from moderate Donald Trumps personnel picks have stayed within the Republican mainstream  few are Trump cronies, and some were even opponents of the president-elect Read more Thats why Clark is alarmed by Donald Trumps nomination of Betsy DeVos to lead the US Department of Education.  DeVos, a billionaire and conservative activist from the state, has been one of the strongest defenders in Michigan of expanding charter schools and choice.  DeVos and her husband, Dick, have long been a force in education policy efforts in Michigan, as well as other sensitive political issues  such as the Michigan legislatures 2012 decision to pass right-to-work legislation. The DeVoses have contributed at least $7m to state lawmakers and Michigans GOP party  including support for a failed $5m effort to pass a pro-school-voucher voter referendum in 2000.  Public education advocates who oppose DeVoss nomination point to Michigans education record  particularly in Detroit, where nearly half of students attend charters.  Since a quarter-century ago, charter advocates have pursued an agenda that has included a lift on the cap for how many can open in the state, as well as an expansion of school choice. Along the way, the states academic performance has dropped, and Detroit has probably felt the biggest impact.  Though charter advocates point to studies that suggest student gains have been made at charters, the citys disconnected array of schools has developed into a frenetic status quo. Just this year, the district has teetered on the edge of bankruptcy, prompting teachers facing potential payless work days to stage mass protests, and a federal lawsuit is now attempting to assert a constitutional right to literacy  an argument couched in the dismal performance scores of Detroit students.  Whats more, the states policies and regulation of charters has been so lax, critics routinely refer to the citys educational landscape as the wild west. Indeed, a federal audit this year noted Michigans charter school law does not include provisions for regulating conflict-of-interest issues. The state also allows for-profit charters to be established, a practice prohibited elsewhere.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Trump stands with Betsy DeVos after their meeting at the main clubhouse at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters Since 1990, Detroits population has dropped nearly 35%, while its school districts attendance has plummeted nearly 75%  a signal of the proliferation of charters and use of choice in the city.  The situation in Michigan is such that even charter advocates criticize the states approach  and DeVoss devotion to maintaining it.  It doesnt matter that charter schools arent giving any of the things they promised 22 years ago, said Stephen Henderson, a Detroit native and editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press, who, along with his two children, attended charters. She ... and her family funds any effort to block any changes or accountability or standards that would perhaps produce better results for us.  But the pick underscored the polarizing views of DeVos. In her home state, Michigans governor and attorney general echoed Trumps remarks about her qualifications.  Dan Quisenberry, president of the Michigan Association of Public School Academies, downplayed criticisms of her background, saying her business experience and previous role as the Michigan GOP chairwoman showed she could lead a large organization and handle political issues.  Betsy is a person who will put kids before adults, he said. Shes going to put students and parents ahead of politics.  Michigan indeed has some high-performing charter schools, including in Detroit. Many supporters point to a 2013 Stanford study that found charter students in the state learned at a faster rate than those in public schools, with two months of gains, or three months in Detroit. Still, the study found that slightly more than half of Detroit charter schools failed to perform significantly better in math and reading than counterparts, some even worse.  This summer, charter school advocates  including DeVoss group, the Great Lakes Education Project  agreed to some additional accountability measures as part of a $617m investment to overhaul the governance of Detroit public schools. Schools must now be assessed regularly, and new schools accredited.  But a provision to create a commission overseeing Detroit schools was stripped from the legislation after intense lobbying by charter advocates and DeVos.  What they feared was the accountability, Henderson, 46, said.  DeVos  whose father-in-law founded Amway, a marketing company that previously settled tax fraud accusations for $25m  has long leveraged her wealth to target Republicans who have not boosted her education agenda. After the commission was derailed, DeVos donated $1.45m to state Republican lawmakers over a two month period.  Henderson said GOP lawmakers had told him that in the runup to the decision to axe the Detroit commission, DeVos explicitly stated that she wouldnt donate to their campaign efforts if they didnt flip their votes on the issue.  Trumps transition team declined to make DeVos available for an interview and did not provide comment for this story.  Quisenberry said critics  namely, teachers unions  who point to DeVos political influence usually are involved very much in the same influence on the other side  What the [Detroit commission] was about was whose political influence was going to win out, he said. The teachers union was very involved.  Clark believes the commission would have addressed the distribution and quality of of schools in the city - in his neighborhood, there is just one operational school for 3,000 kids.  If schools in our neighborhood were open, and up to standards, and producing a quality educational experience, then we wouldnt have had to go to four different schools all over the city, Clark said.  Clark now sends his three older kids to private school. But he knows that is off the table for many other parents in the city, where 40% of residents live below the poverty line.  What about the parents who arent in that position?"

109,Satire,"NATION UNSURE IT CAN TOLERATE THIRTEEN MORE DAYS OF RUDY GIULIANI NEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)With thirteen days until his scheduled return to oblivion, many Americans are unsure if they can tolerate that much additional exposure to Rudy Giuliani, a leading psychologist said on Wednesday.  As millions of Americans actively count down the days until Giuliani disappears forever, thirteen more days of him seems like a lifetime, Davis Logsdon, a psychologist who has been studying the Giuliani ordeal, said.  Americans traumatic experience of Rudy Giuliani in 2016 has gone through several phases, Logsdon said. First, they struggled to remember who he was. Then, once they remembered, they recoiled in horror. Finally, they began actively wishing he would go away forever. That is the phase many people find themselves in today.  Even as they long for the day when Giuliani resumes his rightful place in obscurity, many Americans are experiencing feelings of anger and disbelief that he was permitted to crawl back into their consciousness to begin with, Logsdon said. Of the many inexcusable things that cable news has done this election, repeatedly subjecting Americans to Rudy Giuliani is at the top of the list, he said. The human cost has been enormous.  As they struggle to endure the final thirteen days of Rudy Giuliani, Americans should not feel isolated or alone, Logsdon said. They need to know that there are millions of people just like them, and even more who are unsure if they can stand another thirteen days of Kellyanne Conway, he said."

111,Satire,"Karnataka minister who was caught watching obscene pictures claims he was reading TOI online Bengaluru: Recently one Karnataka minister was caught watching obscene pictures during Tipu Jayanti celebration. This has given opposition BJP a chance to corner ruling congress which made a lot of hue and cry few years back when BJP ministers were caught doing the same inside assembly.  TOIJust browsing TOI Like the old BJP ministers, the Karnataka minister has denied the allegations strongly. First of all, why I would watch such stuff on a 5-inch smartphone, when I have an iMac with 100 mbps dedicated internet line at home, said the minister with an angry tone while speaking to us.  The minister added, There is no time for people like me to read newspapers. While attending functions, if I get some time, instead of sleeping on the dais, I go through some online newspapers.  Probably when I was going through TOI (The Online India), some mischievous journalist took the video and shared with opposition and news channels. My question to all my detractors, where it is written, one cannot read a widely circulated daily like TOI when you are at public places. In fact, I would say it was an off day for the newspaper by its own high standard. There was hardly anything for excitement, said the minister.  The minister said, If these people are so concerned, what our kids are learning from this, then let them bring certain level of censorship. For some pages they can easily do an adult check in online version, through GPS they can track the place from where one is accessing and put a warning i.e. to watch such stuffs, go to your private area immediately.

112,Fake,"Ted Cruz: I Will Endorse Donald Trump For President If He Makes Masturbation Illegal WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP)  U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) sent shockwaves through the Republican Party today when he announced that he would endorse Donald Trump for President, but only if the GOP nominee would be willing to publicly support a ban on masturbation. The Senator called this The single most important issue facing the country today and that without swift action by the next President the country was doomed to slide down a slippery slope of debauchery and self-satisfaction.    Self-love is a silent killer in this country. This needless act of hedonistic indulgence is leading our children down a dark and destructive path. It starts innocently enough with a JC Penney catalogue tucked under your mattress, but it quickly spirals out of control, and before you know it, your mother has to call the coroner because youve died from auto-erotic asphyxiation. Im not saying that we should lock up these one armed bandits and throw away the key; what we need is a compassionate approach that helps these deviants reform and become productive members of society. That is why I believe a prison sentence of three to five years will help motivate these heathens to change their evil ways and stay off the Devils playground for good, Cruz said. Im asking Mr. Trump to acknowledge the severity of this problem, and commit to finding real solutions. If he does that, I will do whatever it takes to help him secure the White House in November. Should Mr. Trump decline, I think its safe to say that all options, including a third party run, are out on the table.  Donald Trump told ABC News that he was open to the idea, though he refused to take a clear stand on the issue.  Look, do I think Ted Cruz is right about this? Maybe he is, maybe he isnt. To be honest, I dont know a lot about this subject matter. I dont need to. I have a wife that takes care of this for me, and shes a beautiful wife, the best wife, the greatest wife. My people are going to take a hard look into this matter and find a great answer for it, the best answer there is. I want an endorsement from Senator Cruz, and I think I can go along with his request that makes pleasuring your genitalia for non-reproductive purposes illegal.  This is not the first time that Cruz has attempted to use his political power to curtail the act of self-stimulation. As solicitor general of Texas in 2007 he fought to uphold the states ban on sex toys by arguing that there was no Right to stimulate ones genitals. Cruz eventually lost this battle, but the story re-surfaced this year and gained widespread media attention, prompting Cruzs former college roommate Craig Mazin to tweet that Cruzs stance against stimulating ones own genitals was A new belief of his, implying that much of Cruzs time in college was, in fact, spent stimulating his own genitals. Another one of Cruzs former college roommates, Matt Daemon, has recently come forward to corroborate Mazins story.  All Ted Cruz did was take care of little Ted Cruz back then, which is fine I guess, but he was always real creepy about doing it. Honestly, I lost track of the number of times I came home to find him laying on the couch naked, lotion and Kleenex next to him, watching re-runs of Walker Texas Ranger. He wouldnt even try and cover up when I caught him, he would just stare at me in the eyes and continue until I left the room. Its absolutely hilarious about the tough stance on touching ones self that Ted has taken in this country. I truly believe he may have pulled on it one too many times and it broke or something and now feels that if he cant do it anymore, then no one can.    Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that she is sickened by the Republican party.  It is absolutely disgusting that in this day in age, a creepy weirdo like Ted Cruz was almost elected as the GOP nomination for President, Bradley said. With all the real problems in this country like starvation, so many people out of work and families living on the street, Cruz is focused on making pleasuring yourself a crime. Bradley continued, Also, I just want to say a big thank you to everyone that has supported our cause in giving new socks to the homeless, it means so much. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps.  Cruz, however, remains undeterred by his detractors. When you play with your Devil stick or ring the Devils doorbell you make the angels in heaven weep, and they are weeping for this country 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. America needs strong moral leadership, and I pray that Donald Trump is up to the task. The fate of our great nation is in his hands; hopefully, theyre big enough to handle it.  Most pundits expect Trump to answer Cruzs call and demand a stiffer approach to the matter. A recent poll by the New York Times found that 43% of likely Trump voters support a ban on self-stimulation due to moral and religious concerns. Another 46% would be okay with a ban, saying that they, like Trump, have far too many potential suitors, and therefore do not need to satisfy their own urges. Only 11% of Trump supporters are against a ban.  RNC political strategist, 37-year-old Paul Horner, calls the move a no-brainer and says that Trump would be foolish to turn his back on Cruz.  Conservatives are siding with Cruz overwhelmingly on this issue. If Donald does not side with the Senator, he risks alienating the partys Christian base and opening the door for a third party run by Cruz which would fracture the vote and all but guarantee a victory for Clinton. Trump needs to agree with Cruz on this one, no matter how creepy, insane and absolutely horrible of a person he is.  David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.  You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the gender reassignment surgery my wife Barbara has always wanted since she was a little boy, Mikkleson said. We claim to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well, but thats just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and thats it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and Im only telling you this for legal reasons. For example, do you remember that recent article we wrote debunking a story which claimed Scientology lost its tax-exempt status? Did you actually read our story? Who is the name of the person responsible for the hoax? What is the actual website URL? We claim to know it, but no real information is posted by us. Mikkelson continues, It is common for us to rewrite a story were debunking if we dont like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a persons name from the original article and then called him a liar, oh the hypocrisy, but it is so funny at the same time! We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search that locates the actual article will show that our disclaimer is 100% fabricated. Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money, Mikkelson laughs. And lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours. Plus, I know for our writers like Kim LaCapria, it is way more fun for them to cause controversy than report the facts; it results in more visitors. Kim LaCapria and Jeff Zarronandia go as far as accusing the site that the story originated from as a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false news stories. The thing that is troubling about these claims and what Snopes and our authors are known for. We dont list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up any of our claims; Its just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and I only tell you this for legal reasons. I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work? To be honest, Id say in a given week I probably only do about fifteen minutes of real, actual, work.  Regardless of which side Trump takes on the issue, it is certain to invoke heated debate on both sides of the political aisle.

113,Fake,"REPORT: Nine ISIS Supporters Arrested Near Washington D.C. At least nine individuals have been arrested in Northern Virginia for attempting to support ISIS since the group rose to power in 2014, according to a report from law enforcement officials.  According to the report, which was obtained by The Washington Times, the nine individuals were arrested for providing or attempting to provide support to ISIS and included a police officer and several U.S. Army soldiers.  The Washington Times reports:  Law enforcement agencies have arrested nine Northern Virginia residents on charges of aiding the Islamic State since the terrorist group rose to power in Syria and Iraq in 2014 and launched social media propaganda to attract followers, a government message to police states.    Of the nine Northern Virginians who were arrested, all but one were in their teens and early 20s. They included a police officer, a Starbucks barista, Army soldiers, bankers and a cabdriver. Four of the nine graduated from Northern Virginia high schools, one with honors. Two attended Northern Virginia Community College.  According to the Times, one of the men, a U.S. army combat engineer named Mohammad Bilor Jalloh, attempted to purchase firearms in an attempt to carry out a Fort Hood style attack.  Another man, Metro police officer Nicholas Young, traveled to Libya and gave advice to Islamic State followers on how to avoid law enforcement monitoring according to law enforcement officials.  Several others planned on creating online propaganda for the terror group, with one seeking to encourage lone wolf style attacks on Washington DC.  The report raises new concerns about the reach of the terror group into the U.S. homeland, and any future plans to import new refugees from troubled Muslim nations.

114,Fake,"BREAKING BOMBSHELL: NYPD Blows Whistle on New Hillary Emails: Money Laundering, Sex Crimes with Children, Child Exploitation, Pay to Play, Perjury New York Police Department detectives and prosecutors working an alleged underage sexting case against former Congressman Anthony Weiner have turned over a newly-found laptop he shared with wife Huma Abedin to the FBI with enough evidence to put Hillary (Clinton) and her crew away for life, NYPD sources told True Pundit.  NYPD sources said Clintons crew also included several unnamed yet implicated members of Congress in addition to her aides and insiders.  The NYPD seized the computer from Weiner during a search warrant and detectives discovered a trove of over 500,000 emails to and from Hillary Clinton, Abedin and other insiders during her tenure as secretary of state. The content of those emails sparked the FBI to reopen its defunct email investigation into Clinton on Friday.  But new revelations on the contents of that laptop, according to law enforcement sources, implicate the Democratic presidential candidate, her subordinates, and even select elected officials in far more alleged serious crimes than mishandling classified and top secret emails, sources said. NYPD sources said these new emails include evidence linking Clinton herself and associates to:  Money laundering Child exploitation Sex crimes with minors (children) Perjury Pay to play through Clinton Foundation Obstruction of justice Other felony crimes NYPD detectives and a NYPD Chief, the departments highest rank under Commissioner, said openly that if the FBI and Justice Department fail to garner timely indictments against Clinton and co- conspirators, NYPD will go public with the damaging emails now in the hands of FBI Director James Comey and many FBI field offices.  Whats in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach, the NYPD Chief said. There is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that.  The NYPD Chief said once Comey saw the alarming contents of the emails he was forced to reopen a criminal probe against Clinton.  People are going to prison, he said.  Meanwhile, FBI sources said Abedin and Weiner were cooperating with federal agents, who have taken over the non-sexting portions the case from NYPD. The husband-and-wife Clinton insiders  are both shopping for separate immunity deals, sources said.  If they dont cooperate they are going to see long sentences, a federal law enforcement source said.  NYPD sources said Weiner or Abedin stored all the emails in a massive Microsoft Outlook program on the laptop. The emails implicate other current and former members of Congress and one high-ranking Democratic Senator as having possibly engaged in criminal activity too, sources said.  Prosecutors in the office of US Attorney Preet Bharara have issued a subpoena for Weiners cell phones and travel records, law enforcement sources confirmed. NYPD said it planned to order the same phone and travel records on Clinton and Abedin, however, the FBI said it was in the process of requesting the identical records. Law enforcement sources are particularly interested in cell phone activity and travel to the Bahamas, U.S. Virgin Islands and other locations that sources would not divulge.  The new emails contain travel documents and itineraries indicating Hillary Clinton, President Bill Clinton, Weiner and multiple members of Congress and other government officials accompanied convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein on his Boeing 727 on multiple occasions to his private island in the U.S Virgin Islands, sources said. Epsteins island has also been dubbed Orgy Island or Sex Slave Island where Epstein allegedly pimps out underage girls and boys to international dignitaries.  Both NYPD and FBI sources confirm based on the new emails they now believe Hillary Clinton traveled as Epsteins guest on at least six occasions, probably more when all the evidence is combed, sources said. Bill Clinton, it has been confirmed in media reports spanning recent years, that he too traveled with Epstein over 20 times to the island.  Laptop Also Unveiled More Classified, Top Secret Breaches  According to other uncovered emails, Abedin and Clinton both sent and received thousands of classified and top secret documents to personal email accounts including Weiners unsecured campaign web site which is managed by Democratic political consultants in Washington D.C.  Weiner maintained little known email accounts that the couple shared on the website anthonyweiner.com. Weiner, a former seven-term Democratic Congressman from New York, primarily used that domain to campaign for Congress and for his failed mayoral bid of New York City.  At one point, FBI sources said, Abedin and Clintons classified and top secret State Department documents and emails were stored in Weiners email on a server shared with a dog grooming service and a western Canadian bicycle shop.  However, Weiner and Abedin, who is Hillary Clintons closest personal aide, werent the only people with access to the Weiners email account. Potentially dozens of unknown individuals had access to Abedins sensitive State Department emails that were stored in Weiners email account, FBI sources confirmed.  FEC records show Weiner paid more than $92,000 of congressional campaign funds to Anne Lewis Strategies LLC to manage his email and web site. According to FBI sources, the D.C.-based political consulting firm has served as the official administrator of the anthonyweiner.com domain since 2010, the same time Abedin was working at the State Department. This means technically Weiner and Abedins emails, including top secret State Department emails, could have been accessed, printed, discussed, leaked, or distributed by untold numbers of personnel at the Anne Lewis consulting firm because they can control where the website and it emails are pointed, FBI sources said.  According to FBI sources, the bureaus newly-minted probe into Clintons use and handling of emails while she served as secretary of state, has also been broadened to include investigating new email-related revelations, including:  Abedin forwarded classified and top secret State Department emails to Weiners email Abedin stored emails, containing government secrets, in a special folder shared with Weiner warehousing over 500,000 archived State Department emails. Weiner had access to these classified and top secret documents without proper security clearance to view the records Abedin also used a personal yahoo address and her Clintonemail.com address to send/receive/store classified and top secret documents A private consultant managed Weiners site for the last six years, including three years when Clinton was secretary of state, and therefore, had full access to all emails as the domains listed registrant and administrator via Whois email contacts. Because Weiners campaign website is managed by the third-party consultant and political email guru, FBI agents are burdened with the task of trying to decipher just how many people had access to Weiners server and emails and who were these people. Or if the server was ever compromised by hackers, or other actors.  Abedin told FBI agents in an April interview that she didnt know how to consistently print documents or emails from her secure Dept. of State system. Instead, she would forward the sensitive emails to her yahoo, Clintonemail.com and her email linked to Weiner.  Abedin said, according to FBI documents, she would then access those email accounts via webmail from an unclassified computer system at the State Dept. and print the documents, many of which were classified and top secret, from the largely unprotected webmail portals.  Clinton did not have a computer in her office on Mahogany Row at the State Dept. so she was not able to read timely intelligence unless it was printed out for her, Abedin said. Abedin also said Clinton could not operate the secure State Dept. fax machine installed in her Chappaqua, NY home without assistance.  Perhaps more alarming, according to the FBIs 302 Report detailing its interview with Abedin, none of the multiple FBI agents and Justice Department officials who conducted the interview pressed Abedin to further detail the email address linked to Weiner. There was never a follow up, according to the 302 report.  But now, all that has changed, with the FBIs decision to reopen the Clinton email investigation and the husband and wife seeking immunity deals to testify against Clinton and other associates about the contents of the laptops emails."

116,Real,"Trump Decries His Foundation's Closure, Overstating Its Giving President-elect Donald Trump is lashing out in defense of his charitable foundation as he prepares to shutter it before taking the oath of office next month.  Trump Plans To Dissolve His Foundation; N.Y. Attorney General Pushes Back THE TWO-WAY Trump Plans To Dissolve His Foundation; N.Y. Attorney General Pushes Back And in doing so, Trump incorrectly stated the charitable reach of the Donald J. Trump Foundation.  In a series of tweets Monday evening, Trump said he had given millions to the foundation he began in 1987 and that all of the money raised went to ""wonderful charities.""  I gave millions of dollars to DJT Foundation, raised or recieved millions more, ALL of which is given to charity, and media won't report! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 27, 2016  The DJT Foundation, unlike most foundations, never paid fees, rent, salaries or any expenses. 100% of money goes to wonderful charities! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 27, 2016 But extensive reporting over the past year has shown those claims to be overstated. According to the Washington Post's David Fahrenthold, who has researched the foundation's donations and expenses for several months, Trump and his companies have given about $6 million to the charity since its launch, according to tax records up to 2015.  However, the president-elect has not given anything to the foundation from 2009 until 2014; his businesses gave to the foundation in 2015 for the first time in several years, according to the Post.  In fact, the two largest donors were professional wrestling magnates Vince and Linda McMahon, who gave $5 million to the foundation from 2007 until 2009. Trump has nominated Linda McMahon to lead the Small Business Administration.  And as Fahrenthold reported during the campaign, not all of the money was solely for charitable purposes. In many cases, spending benefited Trump and his business interests. Trump used his foundation's money to buy a 6-foot-tall portrait of himself for $20,000, and had earlier bought another portrait for $10,000, the Post's reporting showed. He also used the foundation's money to buy an autographed Tim Tebow Denver Broncos helmet for $12,000.  Trump tapped his foundation to help settle lawsuits for his businesses. In one case, Palm Beach, Fla., agreed to forgive fines for Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club if he made a $100,000 donation to a veterans' charity. In another instance, Trump settled a case involving one of his New York golf courses to make a $158,000 donation to a charity of the plaintiff's choosing.  ""So if Trump is using this money basically to save his businesses, the money isn't helping people. That's a violation of the letter and the spirit of law,"" Fahrenthold told NPR's All Things Considered on Sunday.  Trump announced on Christmas Eve that ""to avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways.""  But Trump cannot shutter the foundation just yet since it's under investigation by the New York attorney general, according to the office's spokeswoman Amy Spitalnick. Attorney General Eric Schneiderman ordered the foundation to stop raising money in New York in October, saying it wasn't registered by law to be able to do so in the state.  And last year Trump had to pay a $2,500 fine to the IRS when he used $25,000 of the foundation's money to donate to a group supporting Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. At the time, she was weighing whether or not to pursue an investigation into Trump University; ultimately, she decided not to, and this year was a vocal surrogate for Trump.  RealClearPolitics also reported in October that many of the Trump Foundation's donations in recent years went to top conservative or policy groups that could aid Trump as he prepared for a White House run.  'Saving Lives' Or 'Selling Access'? Explaining The Clinton Foundation POLITICS 'Saving Lives' Or 'Selling Access'? Explaining The Clinton Foundation Throughout the campaign, Trump took sharp aim at his opponent Hillary Clinton's own family foundation, claiming it was a pay-to-play vehicle for the Democratic nominee and her husband, former President Bill Clinton.  ""It is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins. It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons set up a business to profit from public office,"" Trump said at an August rally in Texas. ""They sold access and specific actions by and really for I guess the making of large amounts of money."" Those claims have not been borne out by evidence.  In August, the Clintons vowed to drastically reduce the size of their foundation to avoid appearances of conflict. They denied any insinuation of pay-to-play and defended the work of the Clinton Foundation.  At the time, RNC chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement, ""If everything was above board while Hillary Clinton ran the State Department as the Clintons have said, then why change a thing?""  But now it's Trump and his family who have come under fire for some of the same alleged behaviors. An AP investigation found that Trump's son Eric "" has exaggerated the size of his foundation and the donations it receives. At the same time, the charity's payments for services or donations to other groups repeatedly went to one of Donald Trump's private golf clubs and to charities linked to the Trumps by corporate, family or philanthropic relationships.""  My wonderful son, Eric, will no longer be allowed to raise money for children with cancer because of a possible conflict of interest with... Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2016 my presidency. Isn't this a ridiculous shame? He loves these kids, has raised millions of dollars for them, and now must stop. Wrong answer! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2016 Eric Trump announced last week he would also close his personal foundation after it was auctioning off a coffee with his sister, Ivanka, who is expected to have considerable influence in her father's White House. The president-elect also tweeted about that last Friday, saying it was a ""ridiculous shame"" that Eric would have to stop fundraising for his foundation, which gave much of its money to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.   Back in October, NPR's Joel Rose compared the Trump and Clinton foundations and found some marked differences. While the Clinton Foundation does have hundreds of employees and a large budget, it spent almost 90 cents of every dollar received on charitable causes, such as HIV and malaria prevention in Africa. It's a public charity, meaning it mostly raises money from other people and organizations (including a gift from the Trump Foundation in 2009). And while it did accept money from foreign donors, some of whom wanted meetings when Clinton was secretary of state, ""there's no evidence that big donors got any special favors from the State Department,"" Rose reported.  The Trump Foundation is a private foundation, originally intended to give away Trump's own money. But, as noted earlier, he stopped making personal contributions about eight years ago.  ""The Trump Foundation has engaged in documented, flagrant acts of violation,"" said Pamela Mann, a former head of the charities bureau in the New York attorney general's office, told Rose. ""That's really different."""

Sarah Palin accidentally was briefed first. So, yes, Alaska has been engaged in a secret air war with Russia, Africa is now a country...  10. The Iraq War has actually been over since 2005. Whats been going on since then is what counts in Iraq as peace.  11. As the result of extensive plastic surgery, Osama Bin Laden has successfully penetrated this country, and, whats especially awkward for you, Mr. President-Elect, is that hes been living in the Chicago suburbs under the name ... wait for it ...

118,Fake,"WikiLeaks  Obama Racist Recruiting  No White, Christian Americans Need Apply Back when Hussein Obama first befouled the White House, many naive Americans still gave him the benefit of the doubt in both his honesty and his declaration that he was a Christian. Hes since been revealed as a pathological liar and as a racist white-hating Muslim agitator, but he was operating under a much more stealthy strategy which was moderately effective at masking his destructive goals at the time. WikiLeaks has since made some things much clearer.  There were those who knew what he was up to, but their silence had been purchased. One such individual was Preeta Bansal, who may or may not share Obamas personal characteristics and goals but certainly did nothing to expose his. She was one of the first of innumerable foreigners to be given high positions within the Obama regime, being a naturalized Indian. Obama has frequently used those with the weakest of ties to traditional America as his agents of fundamental transformation and anti-white, anti-American prejudice.  673-bansal-obama-discrimination  As the WikiLeaks leaked Podesta email reveals, Bansal was engaged not only in racist employment discrimination, but religious discrimination against Christians in the recommendation and review process for potential new hires within the executive branch. Thats the kind of thing that Loretta Lynch and her bulldog DOJ Civil Rights Deputy Vanita Gupta would be all over if it were to happen to a Muslim or non-white. Discriminating against whites and Christians is just who we are under this racist America-hating Islamist.  One thing that is important to remember is that this compilation of Muslim and Asian candidates for preferential employment treatment would not have been prepared without it being specifically requested by the inner circle within the Obama administration. Race-based preference was to be given and discrimination against those who were not Muslim or Asian was to be engaged in. Being Arab alone wasnt enough to get you onto the good list. Bansal specifically states that Arab Americans who were not Muslims were not included.  She also acknowledges that she included high profile Muslims even though she believed they would not survive the vetting process due to the attention they would receive from bloggers. Two questions rise from that admission; what kind of people is she seeking that blogger revelations would sink their candidacy and why did she, knowing their background difficulties, still include them as potential recruits?  The WikiLeaks Podesta email from October of 2008, forwarded to John Podesta, which contains the Bansal correspondence is linked here and below:  Fwd: FW: Asian American Candidates, Muslim American Candidates    From:gaylesmithgayle@gmail.com  To: john.podesta@gmail.com  Date: 2008-10-17 08:18  Subject: Fwd: FW: Asian American Candidates, Muslim American Candidates  Lists from Preeta attached.

G  - Forwarded message -  From: Bansal, Preeta D <PBANSAL@skadden.com>  Date: Mon, Sep 29, 2008 at 11:01 PM  Subject: FW: Asian American Candidates, Muslim American Candidates  To: John Podesta <jpodesta@americanprogress.org>, Gayle Smith <  gaylesmithgayle@gmail.com>    FYI also.    ________________________________    From: Bansal, Preeta D (NYC)  Sent: Monday, September 29, 2008 11:01 PM  To: Froman, Michael B  Cc: Onek, Matthew  Subject: Asian American Candidates, Muslim American Candidates    Here are the compiled lists of Asian American and Muslim American  candidates for top Administration jobs, sub-cabinet jobs, and outside  boards/agencies/policy committees. A couple things to note about the list  of Muslim American candidates:    1) In the candidates for top jobs, I excluded those with some Arab  American background but who are not Muslim (e.g., George Mitchell). Many  Lebanese Americans, for example, are Christian. In the last list (of  outside boards/commissions), most who are listed appear to be Muslim  American, except that a handful (where noted) may be Arab American but of  uncertain religion (esp. Christian).    2) There is only one candidate I thought was a viable one for a  Secretary-level job among the Muslim Americans. That said, on both lists,  there are some very senior people listed in the last category (for outside  boards/commissions) who conceivably could be considered for top jobs. The  very senior people I put on the last list tended not to be terribly  involved in politics or policy, or in the case of some Asian Americans,  had already served in the Clinton and even Carter Administrations and so I  thought we should seek new talent. But theres no magic to some of the  placements. I think the lists are fairly exhaustive, but some of the  people may be moved to other categories.    3) High-profile Muslim Americans tend to be the subject of a fair amount  of blogger criticism, and so the individuals on this list would need to be  ESPECIALLY carefully vetted. I suspect some of the people I list would  not survive such a vet  but I do personally know, at least in part,  virtually all of the candidates in the 1st two categories (but I know very  few of those listed for outside boards/commissions).    4) I listed the elected Muslim American democratic officials at the end  of the second category, but for various reasons, I didnt think any of  them would necessarily be suitable for an Administration appointment.  Nevertheless, I wanted to flag them for you in case you wanted to evaluate  them further."
119,Fake,"urkey President Claims Has Video Evidence Obama Is Supporting ISIS President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey is once again making accusations that the United States is directly supporting ISIS. Hes been mixed up in rumors of his supposed profiteering from the illicit ISIS oil trade in the past, so his accusations carry with them a need for healthy skepticism. Still, he is adamant in his allegations and says hes got irrefutable evidence.  His claims go beyond the single step of removal from direct involvement, our maintaining the implausible plausible deniability of aiding the so-called freedom fighters or rebels, the insulation the US has relied upon in arming, training and financing Obamas terrorist allies in the past. Its more than an acknowledgment of the rebranding of ISIS terrorists, our supposed enemy, as anonymous factions under the White House subversive.  Its beyond the contention of the Russians or the photographic evidence that John McCain was foolish enough to provide, what is basically little more than a choice in headscarf colors, the difference between their equivalent of the crips and the bloods, as being the legitimizing factor for aiding our terrorist enemies as the non-existent moderate freedom fighters.  Erdogan said in his Tuesday comments that he has confirmed evidence that US-led forces have supported ISIS. Erdogan stated in no uncertain terms that its very clear the US is supporting ISIS. He said, They were accusing us of supporting Daesh (ISIS). Now they give support to terrorist groups including Daesh, YPG, PYD. Its very clear. We have confirmed evidence, with pictures, photos and videos. YPG and PYD are Kurdish groups that Erdogan regards as terrorists operating against Turkey.  Flanked by the visiting Guinean President Alpha Conde, Erdogan said, The coalition forces are unfortunately not keeping their promises. Whether they do or they dont, we will continue along this path in a determined way. There is no going back on the path we have set out on.  Erdogan complained They are supporting all the terror groups  the YPG, PYD but also including Daesh (ISIS)  Its quite clear, perfectly obvious, he said, adding that Turkey could provide proof in pictures and video. During a November visit to Pakistan Erdogan made similar claims, alleging the West stands by Daesh (ISIS) right now and its weapons were Western-made. At the time he declined to provide his evidence for inspection.  He needs to be more forthcoming this time around. If hes got the evidence, show it. Certainly none of us would be surprised to learn that Obama is behind ISIS, its already well known. We would like to put our hands on his proof, though, in order to properly charge Obama and convict him."
120,Satire,"Government mandates foyer in every building after pressure from lobbyists OTTAWA  Yielding to demands of lobby groups, the Trudeau government has passed legislation that requires all constructed dwellings in Canada to have a clearly defined waiting area.  Its 2016, said Prime Minister Trudeau, as chesterfields, magazines and a water cooler were brought into Parliament. And its a shame there are still buildings out there without any kind of vestibule or antechamber.  Despite containing what many feel are obvious and long-overdue reforms, the sudden and nearly unanimous support of the Lobby Act has raised some eyebrows.  I am disappointed with the current government, said NDP leader Thomas Mulcair. These new regulations are just one example of, metaphorically speaking, Parliament allowing lobbyists in through their front doors and allowing them to sit comfortably in that little waiting area  Oh, I see, added Mulcair.  Private citizens have also expressed displeasure, claiming the new rules to be heavy-handed and disadvantageous to the owners of factory farms, garden sheds and other buildings where a foyer would be out-of-place.  These ridiculous requirements will force me to change the very nature of my product and seek different markets, said Vernon Hills, CEO of porta potty rental company PolyJohn. Where am I going to put a lobby in these things?  At press time, the Bank of Canada announced a new kind of lending cost after persuasion by special interest groups."
121,Satire,"Following criticisms, Liberals vow to legalize weed even more OTTAWA  After sustained criticism over several dozen issues, the Liberal government has promised to solve everything by legalizing weed even more.  We saw that you were angry, so we listened, said Trudeau, referring to national displeasure over pipeline approvals and pay-to-play fundraising among other things. And what we heard is that you want weed to be way more legal than it already is.  The federal government then unveiled an ambitious 90-point plan, tentatively titled Smokescreen 2017, that doesnt address indigenous issues, healthcare, or student debt, instead focusing on making weed like, super duper legal, you know?  I mean this doesnt really solve my problem with their continued backtracking on electoral reform, said local woman Lindsay Gilligan. And, honestly, a lot of this new weed legislation is troubling. Im not sure pot should be mandatory even if the nugs will be 100% dank.  Additionally, Trudeaus plan proposes that all libraries have a box of free doobies, joints, and blunts, that each homeowner must dedicate one room for hydroponics, and completely resolves the carbon tax debate through investment in fuzzy, sticky, green energy if you know what I mean.  We know what every Canadian wants, said Trudeau, tossing dimebags to a crowd of displeased protesters who were objecting to inaction on Bill C-51. Some pot in every chicken and a hotboxed car in every garage.  This is the most successful application of drug policy since Robert Borden legalized opium to make conscription easier."
122,Real,"Trump is within his rights to use executive power, Obama says WASHINGTON  President Obama says he has no regrets about his go-it-alone use of executive power  even if President-elect Donald Trump can now use those same powers to roll back his policies.  ""I think that he is entirely within his lawful power to do so,"" Obama said in an interview with National Public Radio broadcast Monday. ""If he wants to reverse some of those rules, that's part of the democratic process.""  In his traditional end-of-year public radio interview, Obama offered a wide-ranging defense of his use of presidential power as he prepares to turn the levers of that power over to man he once described as unfit for the presidency.  Obama argued that his use of executive action wasn't much different from his predecessors. What changed, he said, is that Congress became less willing to pass legislation.  ""Congress has become so dysfunctional that more and more of a burden is placed on the agencies to fill in the gaps, and the gaps get bigger and bigger because they're not constantly refreshed and tweaked,"" he said. ""And the bottom line is, if you want to right-size executive power relative to the other branches of government, the best way to do that is to have a healthy Congress in which the two parties are debating, disagreeing but also occasionally working together to pass legislation.""  The same thing has happened on foreign policy, he said. The Obama administration has been relying a post-9/11 congressional war authorization intended for al-Qaeda in order to battle the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.  ""The danger is that over time, Congress starts feeling pretty comfortable with just having the president do all this stuff and not really having to weigh in,"" he said. ""The president and the executive branch are always going to have greater latitude and greater authority when it comes to protecting America, because sometimes you just have to respond quickly and not everything that is a danger can be publicized and be subject to open debate.""  But Obama also said he's installed ""guardrails"" on the president's war powers, setting up systems of internal accountability on issues like drone strikes and electronic surveillance by the National Security Agency.  ""You know, there are some critics on the left who would argue we haven't gone far enough on that. I would argue that we've gotten it about right, although I'm the first one to admit that we didn't get it all right on day one,"" he said."
123,Fake,"Dear Media LIARS: Heres Who Is REALLY Responsible For Berlin Terror Attack The Berlin attack is opening peoples eyes to the situation at hand, and they are blaming terrorist organizations like ISIS, but theyre not the only ones facing peoples wrath.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing huge backlash in the aftermath of the terrorist attack that killed 12 peoplebecause of her open immigration policies, as per The Sun.  Many people are saying it is because of her that this attack took place, because of her sympathy for Muslim refugees seeking asylum in any country that will take them.  But theres one problem with these refugeeswherever they go, attacks, murders, and rapes are increasing. Anywhere where these migrants are, violence follows.  Its not looking good for the chancellor, who is up for reelection soon. She may not even get a chance to do so with so many of the German people calling for her blood. Many are blaming her for these deaths of innocent people.  These are Merkels dead, said Marcus Pretzell, chairman of the Alternative for Germany party in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Klaus Bouillon of Merkels CDU party also said to Saarland radio: We must state that we are in a state of war, although some people who want to see only the good cannot see.  Merkel was attending the ironically named International Day of Migrants when the attack took place, and she stated she was shocked and shaken by the tragedy that had taken place. Merkel can pretty much kiss her career goodbye.  The German people are no longer as sympathetic to immigrants as some German politicians, due to the increase in assaults they are witnessing. Similar incidents have taken place in Ansbach, Cologne, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Dortmund, Dusseldorf, Stuttgart, and Bielefeld.  Merkels opponents are sure to be gaining more popularity as more are leaning towards the right and calling for these refugees to be booted out of the country. Many European countries are regretting their decisions to let these migrants into their countries.  This is why so many are intolerant of the Islamic faith and having these immigrants in their countriesviolence seems to follow them everywhere they go since for every three or four peaceful Muslims, there is one bent on destruction. Many other countries, including America, have seen increased attacks stemming from these migrants.  They all need to go back to their own countries, plain and simple. Its like being in a destructive relationshiptheyre already going to tear themselves down, but if you cut-sling, you dont have to go down with them. And the American people are not going down with them.  And Im sure that the German people dont want to go down either. Merkel is sure to not be elected next year for her fourth term as chancellor, especially with Pretzell laying the blame at her feet. Its time to cease the sympathy for Muslim migrants, because its only hurting the countries that take them in."
124,Fake,"Obama To Issue Executive Order Extending Presidential Term Limits WASHINGTON, D.C.  President Barack Obama will exercise his presidential powers this week when he signs an executive order directing the Supreme Court to indefinitely suspend the 22nd Amendment. Coming on the heels of the Conservative Political Action Conference held at Marylands National Harbor, President Obama announced his decision to temporarily end presidential term limits, saying, Im not seeing any potential presidential candidates on either side of the aisle who are capable of carrying out the task of running the country.  Citing poor performance on the part of a Republican-controlled congress, the struggling economy, and the continuing situation with ISIS, Obama said he feels obligated to continue his term in order to steer the country away from crisis just like Roosevelt.  This is not something out of the ordinary, says political analyst Elliot Stabler. We already have several states with no gubernatorial term limits. Connecticut, Idaho, Massachusetts, Washington, Vermont, New York, just to name a few. In fact Michael Bloomberg repealed term limits in order to run for a third time as New York City mayor.  In addition Mr. Obama has ordered the National Guard to remain on standby in the months leading up to and during his third term. He will issue a second executive order authorizing the Department of Justice to temporarily suspend Habeas Corpus in the event a state of emergency is declared due to opposition to his decision to continue the presidency.  The Twenty-second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution was ratified on February 27th, 1951 and sets a limit of two four-year terms for the office of the President of the United States. Since ratification there have been several unsuccessful attempts to repeal the 22nd Amendment. Most recently Democratic congressman Barney Frank and Senator Harry Reid introduced legislation to repeal presidential term limits. Republican Senator Mitch McConnell has sought to pass similar legislation. All three congressmen support Obamas decision to take on another term, which begins January 20th, 2017."
125,Real,"Clinton FBI Director Backs Trump's Attorney General Pick Jeff Sessions, Defends His Records on Civil Rights The campaign to rally support for Donald Trumps pick to head the Justice Department is growing, with former FBI Director Louis Freeh, who served under President Bill Clinton, now joining the effort.  In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Freeh offered his strong recommendation that Senators confirm their colleague Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., as the next attorney general, defending his record on civil rights, which has become a key concern for critics.  I have known Jeff since 1989 when we worked together as prosecutors on one of the most important civil rights cases investigated and prosecuted by the United States Department of Justice, Freeh wrote. [I] have always been greatly impressed with his commitment to the rule of law, his fair and balanced prosecutorial judgment, and his personal dedication to protecting civil rights.  What Jeff Sessions Has Said About Race and Civil Rights After Sessions was announced as Trumps pick for attorney general, top Democrats and some civil rights groups expressed concern over decades-old allegations that he made racist remarks when he was U.S. Attorney in Alabama. Others alleged -- under oath during his 1986 confirmation hearings for a federal judgeship -- that he once called a white civil rights lawyer a disgrace to his race and dubbed some efforts by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ""un-American.""  During the hearings, one lawyer who worked with Sessions claimed the lawmaker told him he thought the KKK was ""OK until I found out they smoked pot."" Sessions said the comment was a joke but apologized.  Under oath himself, Sessions also insisted he harbored no racial bias and said the allegations were either false or being taken out of context. He was nevertheless blocked from becoming a judge.  In his letter on Tuesday, Freeh pointed to Sessions work on the 1989 murders of a federal judge in Alabama and an NAACP official in Georgia.  I was struck with Jeffs fierce determination to solve these civil rights murders, which so gravely impacted the rule of law and the guarantee of civil rights in America, Freeh wrote, noting that, Jeff and his office were key decision-makers in formulating and implementing the investigative strategy which ultimately led to the arrest and conviction of Walter Moody for these murders.  Meanwhile, a conservative judicial organization, the Judicial Crisis Network, has created an entire website devoted to pushing Sessions' confirmation.  He is a world-class legal mind and a tough but fair lawyer with invaluable experience, says the website, ConfirmSessions.com. Known for his deep respect for the Constitution and adherence to the rule of law, Sen. Sessions has worked tirelessly to defend the civil rights and legal rights of all Americans.  Democratic Party leaders, meanwhile, have called Sessions nomination deeply troubling.  Over the course of his career, Senator Sessions used the power of the courts to discriminate against civil rights leaders, allegedly used racially charged language to disparage minorities, expressed support for the KKK and then tried to dismiss it as a joke, celebrated the gutting of the Voting Rights Act, opposed same-sex marriage, denied the constitutionality of Roe v. Wade, voted against greater access to healthcare for veterans, blocked the Paycheck Fairness Act, and voted against the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act,"" Democratic National Committee Interim Chair Donna Brazile said in a statement last month.  Freeh, who served as FBI director from 1993 to June 2001, expressed no such concerns, calling Sessions a friend who has had a distinguished career in public service.  I believe that Jeff will be an outstanding Attorney General for the Nation, Freeh said."

Writing for the majority, Justice Scalia stated, Since 1965, citizens across the nation have lived under the tyranny of being forced to elect people to represent them. This is an important step to free them from that unfair and heinous obligation.   Justice Scalia added that the Voting Rights Act had thrust upon the shoulders of millions of Americans the terrible and unwanted burden of exercising their rights in a democracy.

130,Fake,"Putin Goes On LIVE TV And CONFIRMS That Obama And Hillary Created ISIS Trump said that Obama had a hand in creating ISIS. Now that Donald Trump is the president-elect, Vladimir Putin, of all people, has confirmed this.  Putin said the Syrian rebels are mercenaries who only fight for whomever pays them more. While the president of Russia did not come out and say it is America arming them, he definitely, strongly hinted at it.    Of course, this is the type of flawed leadership we have come to expect under the Obama administration. Putins strong words have also, sadly, been confirmed by other sources.  A Wikileaks report last August proved that Hillary actually lied under oath when she was asked about the weapons trade program that occurred with Syria starting a year before the Benghazi attacks. In the batch of leaked emails, an astonishing 17,000 of them were about Syria alone, as per The National Review.  Something tells me this isnt the type of experience that the Clinton team was going for when they were squaring off against Trump, but this is also solid verification of Putins statement.  In Clintons attempts to win what would essentially have been a third term for Obama, she would have contributed to the international discord and unrest we have all become painfully aware of.  Lets get something absolutely clear: in a world where America is not dominant on the world stage and where ISIS is allowed to grow stronger, those who love freedom lose. Those who believe in all our countrys wonderful principles would soon see them slip away.  The United States of America simply could not afford to have more of the same. We, and the rest of the world, could not afford to have the ISIS rebels grow stronger and more organized. In the midst of all this, Donald Trump began to throw out massive truth bombs, including that Obama and Clinton created ISIS by virtue of their policies. This seemed incredibly outrageous to liberals.  However, credit Trump for being bold enough to say it. This is definitely the type of leadership we need. There is no question it is a sad day in America when it is Vladimir Putin who sounds more like an American than even our own sitting president. Thankfully, well soon have a true leader in the White House.  Seriously, Obama, this isnt a game. This is being the leader of the free world.

In an official statement, Trump said that El Chapos tremendous success in the private sector showed that he has what it takes to shake things up at the D.E.A.  Trumps appointment of the former drug lord surprised many in Washington, in no small part because acrimony between the two allegedly prompted El Chapo, in 2015, to put a hundred-million-dollar bounty on Trumps head.  But, appearing on CNN, the Trump surrogate Kellyanne Conway said that the selection of El Chapo should surprise no one. Mr. Trump always said that he would surround himself with the best people, she said.  When asked why Trump had readily offered a job to El Chapo while still mulling the fate of another former adversary, Mitt Romney, Conway said, El Chapo might not have voted for Mr. Trump, but thats because hes Mexican and in jail, and Mitt Romney is neither.  The appointment of the former drug kingpin is far from a done deal, however, as associates of El Chapo report that he is concerned that being a member of the Trump Administration would be bad for his brand."

134,Real,"Before Trump's Presidency, US Privacy Board in Disarray A federal board responsible for protecting Americans against abuses by spy agencies is in disarray just weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.  The five-member Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board will have only two remaining members as of Jan. 7  and no Democrats even though it is required to operate as an independent, bipartisan agency.  The vacancies mean it will lack the minimum three members required to conduct business and can work only on ongoing projects. Trump would have to nominate new members, who would have to be confirmed by the Senate.  The board was revitalized after former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's disclosures on the scope of U.S. spying in 2013. It notably concluded that the NSA's phone surveillance program was unconstitutional."

136,Real,"Carl Paladino, Trump campaign N.Y. co-chair, says his derogatory Obama remarks were a ""mistake"" ALBANY, N.Y. - A businessman who co-chaired the Trump campaign in New York state said Tuesday his recent derogatory statements about President Barack Obama and his wife werent meant for publication but were nevertheless inappropriate and a mistake.  Carl Paladino said he intended his email response to a weekly alternative publications survey to only go to a couple friends, not the newspaper. He said he mistakenly hit reply on his computer instead of forward.  The millionaire developer told Artvoice last week he hoped President Obama would die from mad cow disease and Michelle Obama would return to being a male.  In Paladinos Tuesday statement, first reported on Buffalos WBEN radio, he apologizes to minorities, saying he never intended to hurt them with his anti-Obama remarks. The comments sparked outrage from various political circles, including Trumps transition team, which called the developers comments absolutely reprehensible.  Paladinos comments even drew a rebuke from his own son William, who runs the familys development firm. The younger Paladino called the statements disrespectful and absolutely unnecessary.  The fathers earlier comments about the president prompted at least two petitions, one calling for his removal from the Buffalo school board and the other seeking the removal of his name from a student town house at St. Bonaventure University, his alma mater and recipient of more than $1 million in donations from Carl Paladino over the years.  Paladino, a school board member since 2013, also said he wont resign his elected position on the board.  No, Im not leaving the school board, he said in the statement, not when its time to help implement the real choice elements of Trumps plan for education reform.  The board is holding a special meeting Thursday to discuss board member conduct. In New York, school board members typically can only be removed by the state education commissioner.  Paladino, 70, unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2010 as a Republican. The Democrat who defeated him, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, called the comments about the Obamas racist, ugly and reprehensible.  Paladino made the comments Friday in response to an Artvoice survey that asked local artists, performers and business owners for their New Years wish list.  Asked what he would most like to happen in 2017, Paladino responded that he hoped Obama catches mad cow disease after being caught having relations with a cow, dies and is buried in a cow pasture.  Asked who he would like to see go away, he said Michelle Obama.  Id like her to return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla, he wrote.  In an emailed statement to the AP, Paladino, 70, claimed his comments had nothing to do with race but instead reflected his opinion of the presidents performance in office.  Merry Christmas and tough luck if you dont like my answer, he wrote.  As recently as August, Paladino falsely claimed Mr. Obama was not Christian, telling the New York Observer that to average Americans, There is no doubt he is a Muslim.  And in 2010, Paladino was criticized after it was revealed he had forwarded to friends racially charged emails that depicted Mr. Obama as a pimp.  Paladino made no mention of any computer mistakes in a statement he released Friday after the publication posted his comments on its website. Instead, that statement ripped the Obamas, calling the president a yellow-bellied coward and claiming the first lady hated America before her husband won the White House."
137,Satire,"Announcing the Arnold Palmer Party  A Delightfully Refreshing Political Alternative Like growing numbers of Americans, I am disgusted by what presidential historian Douglas Brinkley has accurately but politely described as the hyper-partisanship of todays political discourse.  We are a house badly divided. Worse yet, were like a family where the family members cant even have a civil dinner table conversation. Actually, we cant even keep the lasagna on our plate without flinging a forkful across the table.  The Debt Ceiling Debacle is the latest stop  perhaps the end of the line  on the train to nowhere that the American political conversation has become. Its like the Democrats and Republicans are drag racing down Constitution Avenue, making obscene gestures at each other, hurtling unbeknownst (or, worse yet, knowingly) towards certain death. Only, oh yeah, were in the backseat.  Then there is just the sheer exhaustion of daily exposure to strident, mean-spirited and jabbering politicians who have misplaced their prescriptions for chill pills. I mean, really, a roiling, broiling over-heated non-debate is absolutely the last thing we need in a summer marked with sustained record-breaking temperatures. Its saying a lot when, this July, more Americans will succumb to political exhaustion than to heat stroke.  Its all so enervating. As Huff Post blogger and Columbia University professor Trey Ellis keenly observed a few days back, Cubs fans are less depressed than fans of a brighter American future.  Taxation without Representation  or Sanity  The problem with this political shrilly season  besides the fact that it is bringing us to the brink of financial ruin  is that almost no ones point of view is being represented. This is worse than Taxation without Representation; this is Taxation without Sanity.  Whos to blame for this sorry and troubling state of affairs? Some point their fingers to the Tea Partys cold and calculated hijacking of the Republican agenda. Others blame the Pelosi-Reid Cabal (which, I was surprised recently to learn, is not an indie rock group). All I know is that 200 million or so Americans are left with no voice in whats supposed to be a representative system of government.  Well, just like Howard Beale, anchor of the fictional UBS Evening News from Network, who 35 years ago brought the nation together in frustration, I am also opening up my window to the world and shouting, Im mad as hell, and Im not going to take this anymore!  It is time for America to reestablish and reclaim the middle ground with a third party that we can all get behind. Thats why, today, I am announcing the formation of the Arnold Palmer Party (APP). Our singular goal: to refresh the American political discourse.  Get Down with APP  Our party takes its name from the popular summertime refresher  the Arnold Palmer  a delightful, hard-to-resist combination of iced tea and lemonade named after that famous middle-of-the- fairway golfer (and all-around decent human being), Arnold Palmer.  I mean, really, if iced tea and lemonade  once thought an unlikely and unappetizing combination  can get along...  And consider this important point: the Arnold Palmer Party is steeped  literally and figuratively  in tradition. The Tea Party may invoke the famous goings-on in Boston Harbor 238 years ago; hell, we drink from that cup. Further, the Arnold Palmer Party is founded on that fundamental expression of American optimism and resolve: When life gives you lemons, make lemonade (and then mix it in equal parts with some fresh-brewed iced tea).  Look, the Tea Party is not without its redeeming qualities. Its hard to argue that we can blithely ignore an ever-expanding Federal government and personal responsibility is almost always a good thing. On the other hand, how much money do really rich people really need and what about the lemonade values of shared responsibility, cooperation, equality and empowerment? Which brings us to the Arnold Palmer Party.  Our party is all about solutions and reinvigoration, about ensuring that the interests of those of us who are not two standard deviations away from the middle remain front and center in the public debate on issues of consequence, and about fostering (indeed, insisting on) a constructive, respectful and unhysterical political conversation. We are founded on these five simple tenets:  We reward collaboration and compromise, not conflict and conflagration; We believe in possibility and creative problem-solving; We only support political candidates who are civil, cooperative and well hydrated; We sign scorecards, not pledges; We believe in fair play.  Lets reclaim the political conversation. We can do this, America. Like Arnold Palmer (the golfer) once said: The most rewarding things you do in life are often the ones that look like they cannot be done. Like everybody coming together to form an even more perfect Union, maybe?  Its time for a new Arnies Army to assemble and walk the fairways of American political discourse. The Arnold Palmer Party. Join us. Because, after all, whats a party without a beverage?"

139,Fake,"OTTOMANS WERE THE FIRST TO REACH THE MOON, SAYS TURKISH PRESIDENT Istanbul| Ottomans were the first to walk on the surface of the moon, not Neil Armstrong, said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, yesterday, during an iftar (fast-breaking) dinner hosted by the Turkish Green Crescent.  Mr. Erdogan claimed that Muslim explorers reached the Moon more than 300 years before the beginning of the Appolo program, vowing to build a mosque in the crater where they landed.  It is alleged that the first man to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong in 1969, Erdogan said. In fact, Muslim space explorers reached our satellite 334 years before that, in 1635. Everyone knows the story of the famous aviator, Lagri Hasan elebi, the Ottoman Rocket Man, who made the first successful manned rocket flight in 1633. What you might not know, is that he attempted to reach the moon, two years later, and could very well have succeeded!  The story of Lagari Hasan elebi was purported by a famous 17th century Arab merchant and traveller, Mehmed Zilli, also known as Evliya elebi. In his famous travelog, he explains that Lagari Hasan elebi launched in a 7-winged rocket using 50 okka (63.5 kg or 140 lbs) of gunpowder. It took off from Sarayburnu, a site below the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul.  As Evliya Celebi wrote, Lagari proclaimed before launch O my sultan! Be blessed, I am going to talk to Jesus!, before lighting the rockets gunpowder.  He then ascended more than 200 meters in the air and landed in the sea, hundreds of meters from his takeoff point. Swimming ashore, he allegedly reported: O my sultan! Jesus sends his regards to you!.  This 17th-century engraving depicts one of Lagri Hasan elebis famous rocket flights, but its unclear if it represents his first flight or his attempt to reach the moon, in 1635. President Erdogans surprising claim generated some whispers and laughter from the audience, a reaction that clearly angered the Turkish politician. He slammed the skeptics for mocking his claims, adding that he would soon have the proofs to back his claims.  Why do you not believe it? Because youve never believed that a Muslim can do such a thing, just like youve never believed that our ancestors could manage to launch ships in the Golden Horn after transporting them across land, Erdogan said, referring to Ottoman Sultan Mehmet IIs conquest of Istanbul in 1453. This claim is not new. A number of academics in Turkey and in the rest of the world have made this claim, and I believe they are right. NASA may have destroyed most of the physical evidence of the Ottomans success during the Apollo 11 mission, but well try to find any evidence that might have escaped the cover up.  The Turkish President did not, however, give any precision about the proofs he was expecting to find nor how he was hoping to gather them.  ottoman The description of the flying engine used by Lagri Hasan elebi is pretty vague and doesnt really allow modern scientists to accurately recreate the design. This sketch shows the basic design as it is described, but is almost certainly incomplete or partially inaccurate. The story of Lagri Hasan elebi is considered a legend by most historians, and most experts believe that it is impossible that the aviator could have survived a flight into outer space.  His first flight was, indeed, addressed in an experiment by the television show MythBusters, on November 11, 2009, in the episode Crash and Burn.  The rocket constructed for the TV show did not adhere closely, however, to Evliya elebis descriptions and the final design did not attempt to utilize materials of the period;  The team noted that Evliya elebi had not sufficiently specified the alleged design used by Lagri Hasan, but concluded that it would have been extremely difficult for a 17th-century figure, without access to modern steel alloys and welding techniques, to land safely or even achieve thrust at all. This conclusion was backed by the fact that, although the re-imagined rocket rose, it exploded in midflight"
140,Fake,"Turkeys Erdogan Says U.S. Supports ISIL: We Have Evidence With Pictures & Videos Turkeys President Recep Erdogan has come out swinging today. With the U.S. led coalition (Britain and France included) recently suffering an embarrassing defeat in Aleppo, Syria when Iranian and Russian forces helped to liberate the city from ISIL, this latest incident could be seen as Turkey throwing salt on the U.S. wound.  Erdogans bombshell statements highlighted what most of the world is now coming to accept as reality:  They [the U.S.] give support to terrorist groups including Daesh (IS/ISIL). We have confirmed evidence, with pictures, photos and videos.  While no videos or pictures have been made public yet, the world can only hope that Erdogan and company can make good on his words by publicly disclosing their alleged evidence.  Adding to the disclosure was Irans Defense Minister Hossein Dehghan:  The Western coalition is of a formal nature, they have no real intention to fight neither in Syria nor in Iraq. We dont see any readiness on their part to play a truly useful and meaningful role in fighting IS, because its them who have raised terrorists and they are interested in keeping them there. Maybe the coalition forces would like to see terrorists weakened, but certainly not destroyed, because those terrorists are their tool for destabilizing this region and some other parts of the world.  Of course, this statement is no longer just a theory or speculation, as U.S. House Representative from Hawaii, Tulsi Gabbard has introduced a bill that would stop the U.S. government from funding and supporting ISIL, both directly and indirectly. Tulsi stated a few things sure to get the attention of many:  If you or I gave money, weapons or support to al-Qaeda or ISIS, we would be thrown in jail. Why does our gov get a free pass on this? The CIA has also been funneling weapons and money through Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar and others who provide direct and indirect support to groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda. This madness must end. We must stop arming terrorists. The Government must end this hypocrisy and abide by the same laws that apply to its citizens.  What is most interesting about Erdogans comments today then is the fact that he is calling out the U.S. government for funding and arming ISIL and other terrorists groups, when he has also been called out for doing the same. Remember from the paragraph above that Tulsi Gabbard said Turkey is one of the countries arming and funding ISIL. We must also remember when Vladimir Putin said the same thing in November of 2015.  So, perhaps Turkey (or certain aspects within the military and intelligence community within Turkey) have stopped coordinating with the CIA and other intelligence groups in helping to aid ISIL. Putin and Erdogan have made it no secret as to their willingness to collaborate more over the past several months. One of the biggest signals of this growing collaboration between Russia and Turkey was the signing of the Turkish Stream pipeline in late October. Additionally, Moscow announced today that they will be intensifying cooperation between Turkey, Iran and themselves within Syria. Maybe, just maybe, Turkey has broken ties with the Western banking/political cabal. Time will tell.  It would make sense though in many ways if Turkey has broken off all or most ties with the Western cabal, as the world sees the writing on the wall for ISIL: Time is short.  Not only was ISIL defeated in Aleppo (the biggest battle to date), but they are being defeated in Mosul, Iraq. Today, Iraqs Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told the world that ISIL would be defeated in Iraq within three months.  Perhaps Turkey has made a full pivot East and is now working to defeat the terrorist group they were once arming and funding. Stranger things have happened. We watch in great anticipation as to what will happen next."
141,Real,"Report: White House preparing response to Russian election interference The Obama administration is preparing to announce a response, which may include cyber-operations, to the alleged Russian interference in last months election, according to a Washington Post report citing anonymous U.S. officials.  The report says that details are still being finalized but are likely to include new economic sanctions.  President Obama has said that his administration would respond to Russian meddling in the U.S. election.  I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections, that we need to take action and we will -- at a time and a place of our own choosing, Mr. Obama told NPRs Steve Inskeep earlier this month. Some of it may be ... explicit and publicized. Some of it may not be.  Intelligence officials believed Russia was involved in the hacking of Democratic servers last summer. Russia dismisses the charges.  Ian Bremmer on impact of Russia hack, China drone controversy A 2015 executive order, as intended, gives the president the authority to respond to foreign cyberattacks. However, officials concluded that the order did not give the president authority to respond to Russian meddling in American elections, prompting a last-ditch effort within the administration to expand the presidents authority on the matter.  According to the Post, officials are also trying to figure out ways to make it difficult for president-elect Trump, who has frequently spoken of improving relations with Russia, from diminishing any response from the Obama administration.  Part of the goal here is to make sure that we have as much of the record public or communicated to Congress in a form that would be difficult to simply walk back, the Post quotes a senior administration official as saying.  The announcement of the response could come as early as this week, the paper states. Officials quoted in the story say they hope to create a deterrent against future election meddling by other nations.  As much as I am concerned about what happened to us in the election, I am also concerned about what will happen to us in the future, the Post quotes an administration official as saying.  I am firmly convinced that the Russians and others will say, That worked pretty well in 2016, so lets keep going. We have elections every two years in this country."

English emerged victorious from a meeting of the conservative National Party caucus. Two other candidates for the job withdrew last week after English gained more support than them. He is to be officially sworn in on Monday afternoon.  His ascension from deputy prime minister follows the surprise resignation last week of John Key after eight years as prime minister.  Key was a popular leader and was expected to contest a fourth straight election next year. But he said he wanted to leave while he was on top and to spend more time with his wife and two children.

143,Real,"Putin Shrugs Off Trump's Tweet On Expanding U.S. Nuclear Capability Russian President Vladimir Putin downplayed Donald Trump's tweet Thursday calling for the United States to expand its nuclear capabilities.  ""There's nothing out of the ordinary here,"" Putin said, since the U.S. president-elect had advocated a stronger military throughout his election campaign.  The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 Putin took a deep dive into U.S. politics on Friday during his annual news conference in Moscow, praising Trump and skewering President Obama and Hillary Clinton. During a marathon Q&A session that lasted almost four hours, reporters kept returning to the accusations of Kremlin interference in the U.S. presidential election. Putin took them on with gusto, at times sounding like a Trump surrogate.  ""The current administration and the Democratic Party leadership are trying to blame all their failures on external factors,"" Putin said.  The Russian president said he agreed with Trump that anybody  even someone lying on their sofa  could have hacked the Democratic National Committee. The most important thing, according to Putin, is the information that came out of the hack, namely the machinations among top Democrats.  America's ""ruling party,"" he said, has clearly forgotten the original meaning of the word ""democratic.""  The fact that a growing number of Republicans has a favorable view of Putin shows that a ""significant portion"" of Americans shares the concerns and ""traditional values"" of Russians, Putin said, adding that mutual sympathy could be the basis for closer relations in the future.  He took issue with Obama's assertion last week that late Republican President Ronald Reagan ""would roll over in his grave"" because of Putin's popularity in the GOP. On the contrary, Putin said, Reagan would be happy that Republicans are winning everywhere and had Trump, who understood the mood of the people.  ""He went all the way, even though only we believed that he would win,"" Putin said to laughter and applause.  On Friday, Trump said in a statement that he received ""a very nice letter"" from Putin, adding that ""his thoughts are so correct.""  In an indication that he's through with Obama, Putin said it's more likely that great Democrats are turning over in their graves. Unlike President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who united Americans, the outgoing administration divided them, Putin said.  Even as he insisted on Russia's inability to sway the U.S. elections, Putin didn't hesitate to criticize the ""archaic nature"" of the Electoral College.  What he didn't mention is that Clinton won the popular vote by almost 3 million votes."

145,Satire,"Obama: Romney Put Profits Ahead of Losses Escalating his attack on Mitt Romney and Bain Capital, President Obama charged yesterday that Romney and Bain put profits ahead of losses.  Obama released two Bain Private Placement Memoranda (PPMs) prepared for investors during Romneys tenure. Obama found the documents disturbing and mean-spirited.  They reveal that Romney and Bain employed the lure of profits to entice investors, Obama claimed. Their sole promise to investors was a good return on investment. In their pitch to investors, Bain completely ignored combating global warming, fighting childhood obesity, and helping homeowners with underwater mortgages.  Even worse, Bain and Romney accepted only those investors willing to pay Bains asking price. Ability to pay was Bains sole criterion for accepting investors. Bain made no attempt to achieve ethnic, racial, gender, or sexual preference balance among their investors, Obama continued.  Bain was in business to make money, Obama declared. Their PPMs prove it. Bain and Romney were blinded by greed. Had they been willing to incur large losses, they could addressed issues that most concern hard-working middle class Americans, such as helping hard-working middle class Americans struggling to pay texting overcharges for their hard-working middle class children.  Obama contrasted his experience as a community organizer with Romneys concern about profits. I was trying to improve the lives of everyone in the community. The only time I focused on money was when our grants needed renewal.  Obama said working for a profit making organization is poor training for a president. The presidents job is to finance deficits, not to maximize profits. Moreover, its the presidents job to assure that everybody in the country has a fair shot by providing government programs that dont work.  Applying the private sectors heartless logic of cost/benefit would decimate government programs, Obama stated. For example, federal job training programs would appear absurdly inefficient until you consider how virtuous these programs make us feel about our good intentions."

During an extravagant ceremony at the Kremlin on Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced he has appointed American actor and martial arts expert Steven Seagal to serve as Tsar of Crimea, the southern Ukrainian peninsula that was annexed by the Russian Federation in March of 2014.  Dubbed Steven the Great by Mr. Putin, the sixty-four year-old Under Siege star will take up residence at the Grand Livadia Palace in the coastal city of Yalta where he will hold power over nearly two million Crimeans. Featuring a breathtaking panoramic view of the Black Sea, the royal residence once served as a summer retreat for Nicholas II, the last tsar of Russia.  This is a momentous day, not just for the people of Crimea, but for all Russians, proclaimed Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev during an appearance on the state-run news network Russia Today. Steven the Great is a legendary martial artist with an extensive background in firearms and marksmanship. Furthermore, he is more proficient and possesses far greater experience in hand-to-hand combat, counter-terrorism operations, and crime fighting than any man on earth excluding His Excellency President Putin.  The prime minister later said Putin has the utmost confidence in Seagals ability to rule Crimea, calling the star of Hard to Kill a firm but gentle leader who is well versed in the art of paternalism. To drive the point home, Putin will hand over command of Russian forces in Crimea  including the Black Sea Fleet based in Sevastopol  to Mr. Seagal upon his arrival at Livadia Palace later this week.  Steven Seagal, who has appeared in a number of martial arts-style action films including Above the Law, On Deadly Ground, and Exit Wounds, was awarded Russian citizenship last Thursday by President Vladimir Putin, who issued a special decree honoring the actor.

Yoko Ono shocked reporters when she admitted to ""having a fling"" with the former Secretary of State after they met during a protest against the Vietnam War in New York in the early 1970s Hillary Clinton has been hit by a series of allegations of being a lesbian in her career which could ruin her bid for the presidency, believe some experts Yoko Ono when asked about her thoughts about Hillarys run for the presidency completely took reporters by surprise.  We met many times during the New York Vietnam War protests in the 1970s, and became very intimate. We shared many of the same values about sexual equality, fighting against the authoritarian, patriarchal, male-dominated society we were raised in she explained.  We had a brief romantic fling when I lived with John in Manhattan and Hillary was studying at Yale, but eventually we lost touch. I am amazed how things are going well for her and wish her the best for her campaign she told reporters during the press conference.  Experts believe the statement could affect the presidential candidates bid for the presidency but previous allegations of Hillary Clintons lesbian past have not seemed to play against the front runner for the 2016 Democratic presidential race yet."
148,Satire,"Obama Finally Fulfills Campaign Promise To Spend One Night In Abandoned Amusement Park CEDAR PLAINS, PAAfter years of delays and mounting criticism from voters and political pundits, President Barack Obama finally followed through on a campaign promise he made in 2008 to spend one night alone in the abandoned Cedar Plains Family Fun amusement park, sources confirmed Wednesday.  At approximately 6 p.m. last night, members of the press reportedly looked on as Obamacarrying only a flashlight, a water bottle, and a backpack full of snacksscaled the 9-foot-high chain-link fence and entered the derelict theme park, making good on a vow that had been a central component of his initial run for the White House.  Eight years ago, I made an oath that if I were elected president, I would spend dusk till dawn in this old, run-down amusement park, and tonight I am fulfilling my obligation to the American people, said Obama, who had been widely accused of favoring other legislative priorities above an overnight stay inside the dilapidated regional attraction that shut its doors in 2003. Between now and sunrise, I will climb to the top of the Ripsaw roller coaster, I will throw a rock through the window of the snow cone stand, and just as Ive said time and time again, I will wander around in the big concrete track where the Lazy River used to be.  And to prove that I do not take your support for granted, I will also walk through the Hall of Mirrors at midnight, Obama added.  Since first raising the issue during the 2008 primaries, Obamas promise to spend at least 12 hours unaccompanied within the overgrown park grounds has been a focal point of his domestic policy. Throughout the general election, his repeated vows to climb down into the basin under the Gophers Gulch log flume and spend 10 minutes inside one of the rusted cars on the Ferris wheel became fixtures of his stump speeches and TV ads, characterizing the young Illinois senator as the only candidate willing to brave the eerily barren park in the dead of night.  However, with the pledge still unfulfilled after Obamas first 100 days in office, activists began protesting outside the White House regularly, demanding to know when the president would finally put on a thick coat, walk across the propertys cracked parking lot to the padlocked gates, and implement his much-discussed plan to stroll down Cedar Plains debris-strewn midway under the light of a full moon.  At a time of great strife when Americans were looking for something to rally around, Obama united the country by swearing that one of his top goals would be to crawl under the wooden barricades and investigate the parks old food court, said political analyst Mark Halperin, noting that Obama built momentum around his candidacy and attracted sizable political donations whenever he mentioned the possibility of finding old funnel cake and cotton candy machines that had gone unused for years. So perhaps it was inevitable that there would be backlash when Obamas first two years elapsed without him providing even a basic outline of how he would break into the amusement park or a list of which of the decrepit rides he would see if he could turn back on.  Frankly, he got lucky when the bin Laden raid took everyones attention away, or else he may not have been reelected, Halperin added.  In an effort to help secure his presidential legacy, Obama returned to his campaign pledge earlier this year, announcing to the nation during his State of the Union address that he had purchased a sleeping bag in anticipation of spending a night in the park, and later telling graduates in a speech at Howard University that before he left office, he would do everything in his power to take a picture from inside the Gravitron to show people what it looked like in there now.  I was really impressed with Obama when he was first running because he seemed like the only candidate who actually had the will and the temperament to spend the whole night in a spooky boarded-up amusement park, said Kansas City, MO resident Angie Hartney, noting that the then-senators claim was one of the primary reasons she supported him in 2008. I still think he shouldve done this back in his first term, but after all the compromises and excusesand it seeming like hed never actually go down into the underground storage rooms where they supposedly keep some of the old bumper carsits great to know he still has the power to inspire people.  Thats the Obama I voted for, added Hartney.  At press time, the presidents approval rating had risen to an all-time high as an exhausted but triumphant Obama emerged from the park holding a tattered stuffed animal from the shuttered ring toss stand."
149,Real,"Electoral College Vote Seals Trump White House Victory The Electoral College formalized Donald Trump's election victory on Monday despite protests around the country to encourage GOP electors to abandon the Republican.  The president-elect easily racked up the 270 electoral votes needed to send him to the White House. Interest in the normally mundane voting process spiked this year as opposition to Trump continues to fester, fueled by Clinton's success in capturing over 2.6 million more votes than her Republican opponent.  ""Today marks a historic electoral landslide victory in our nation's democracy,"" Trump said in a statement. ""I thank the American people for their overwhelming vote to elect me as their next President of the United States.""  He added, ""this election represents a movement that millions of hard working men and women all across the country stood behind and made possible. With this historic step we can look forward to the bright future ahead. I will work hard to unite our country and be the President of all Americans.""  Anti-Trump protesters descended on state capitols throughout the U.S. in a last-ditch effort to persuade so-called ""faithless electors"" in states Trump won to change their vote. Many of the Republicans casting ballots said they were inundated with calls and emails urging them to dump Trump.  And some electors did break with how their state voted, albeit in unexpected ways. In Washington, a state Clinton won by 16 points, the former secretary of state received just eight of the state's 12 electoral votes. Colin Powell received three votes and Native American tribal leader Faith Spotted Eagle received one as part of an effort to promote a candidate other than Trump.  See Protester Interrupt Wisconsin Electoral College Vote 0:42 An elector in both Maine and Minnesota attempted to cast a ballot for Bernie Sanders, who unsuccessfully challenged Clinton in the Democratic primary. However state laws requiring electors to follow the statewide vote invalidated both efforts.  Only one Republican elector, Christopher Suprun of Texas, publically pledged not to vote for Trump despite his state heavily favoring the president-elect last month. One other Texas elector also abandoned Trump in the final vote.

150,Real,"Walmart pulls 'Black Lives Matter' shirts from website after cop complaints Walmart removed several varieties of shirts and hoodies with the slogan Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter from its website, a spokesperson confirmed Wednesday, after a police union complained they were offensive.  Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise, said a spokesperson for the worlds largest retailer, with more than $482 billion in revenue. After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the bulletproof reference.  The head of the Fraternal Order of Police wrote an open letter to Walmart Tuesday night requesting that the company to take down Black Lives Matter merchandise from its website.  Canterbury wrote that the clothing would damage your companys good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers. The FOP calls itself the worlds largest law enforcement group, claiming more than 330,000 members in 2,200 lodges.  At a time of year when we as a nation and indeed, as a world, should be coming together in hopes of peace on Earth and goodwill toward men, these third party sellers are profiting from racial division, he added.  The right-wing website Breitbart drew attention to the presence of Black Lives Matter shirts on Walmarts site earlier this month, which prompted some on Twitter to call for a boycott of the retailer.  Like many retailers doing business online, Walmart offers merchandise from third-party sellers on its website, which can be distinguished by a small note on the product page.  As of Wednesday afternoon, shirts with the Bulletproof slogan could not be found on Walmarts website. Plenty of other merchandise with phrases like Black Lives Matter, Blue Lives Matter, All Lives Matter and even Journalists Lives Matter was available at $18 to $42 apiece."
151,Fake,"WHOA  Liberals Attacked Trump Inauguration Singer, But They Got KNOCKED OUT by America! Finding a performer for the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump has not been easy, because many famous Liberals are still sitting up on their high horses.  Jackie Evancho, a teenage opera singer who got her start on Americas Got Talent, has agreed to sing the National Anthem for the inauguration. Many liberals have attacked her and her family, but proud Americans have supported her. Her music sales have quadrupled thanks to the American people! (via Breitbart)  Evanchos 2011 Dream With Me album and her 2010 O Holy Night are both sitting at No. 2 on the Billboard charts because of the American people and the pride they have in their country and this talented girl!  For her part, Jackie Evancho has expressed her excitement to sing at this event, which is a breath of fresh air compared to the other singers who have flat out refused to be a part of it, even though they were not even asked in the first place.  I have recently been asked by the President-elect to perform the National Anthem for the swearing-in ceremony at the inauguration, Evancho stated. Im so excited. Its going to be awesome. At least someone has some American pride.  But liberals, of course, arent about to hold back their disdain, even against a teenage girl. This is particularly ironic because of the details of Evanchos family.  My family is kind of a big target. I have a transgender sister and so a lot of hate goes towards us, Evancho claimed. But I also get a lot of love. So, we pay most attention to that. Sometimes we get really annoyed with the hate, everyone does, we have to admit it but we just ignore it.  So, Liberals are adding further hate directed at an innocent family who are trying to support their transgender member. I thought liberals were supportive of transgender people? Apparently they only care about the hate directed at them if the transgender person agrees with their political views.  At 16, Jackie Evanchos list of accomplishments already includes six studio albums. Her O Holy Night EP made her the youngest solo artist to reach platinum on the U.S. Billboard and also ranked her as the No. 1 Classical Albums Artist of 2011.  As one of the few people who are scheduled to perform for Donald Trumps inauguration, the young singer clearly has a ton of talent. The Radio City Rockettes and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir also planned to perform for the incoming President.  Liberals are nothing but a bunch of sore losers, and the fact that they would harass a young girl because of her choice to perform is sickening. The truth is, Liberals will direct their hatred at anyone if they cant get their way."
152,Fake,"Escaped ISIS Sex Slave Goes Before Congress, DESTROYS Obama With 1 Devastating Sentence A woman who knows first-hand the brutality of ISIS testified before Congress not too long ago, and she had some pretty damning words for outgoing President Obama.  The USA must act. We must terminate DAESH [Islamic State] and all such terror, former ISIS sex slave Nadia Murad said through a translator.   Murad, who escaped captivity in 2014, also spoke out on the Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando that killed 49 Americans. She said she wasnt surprised.  I knew if ISIS were not stopped, they would spread their crimes everywhere.  And just like a cancer that continues to metastasize and slowly eat away at a persons insides, her self-fulfilling prophecy has come true in more ways than one.  Obama is just like an inept doctor in that regard, and Murad called him out on it:  If a country as strong as your country cannot protect its citizens in Orlando, or in Belgium or in France, how come a small minority like us can protect ourselves while we are in the heart of the land where radicals are? Murad said bravely.  Well, Ms. Murad, it might have something to do with the fact we are knee-deep in the bull pen called political correctness. Obamas decision not to call radical Islamic terrorism by its name and his choice to redact the original 9-1-1 transcript from the Pulse gunman bore witness to that fact back in June.  And where was the outrage after the Pulse massacre when the 2013 FBI investigation into the gunman was dropped due to concerns of Islamophobia? Where is the outrage now that 12 people in Berlin are dead and their families devastated? Wheres the outrage that Russia has responded appropriately while we are still sitting on our butts? Dont we realize President Obama could have prevented all of this a long time ago?  Ill bet Nadia Murad does. Our president should have lost his right to govern for not responding effectively to this threat. He and his liberal brethren just call people on the other side of the aisle racist and allow the bodies to continue to pile up due to their inept leadership.  H/T: Angry Patriot Movement  What do YOU think about this former ISIS sex slave and her warning to take the threat of radical Islamic terrorism seriously? Please share this story on Facebook and tell us because OUR voice is YOUR voice!"
153,Satire,"Ontario government successfully prepares generation of children who dont know if $300 billion debt big or small TORONTO  The emergence of EQAO test results that show half of grade 6 students failing to meet the provincial math standard has prompted the Ontario government to reveal their plan to raise a generation that cannot make sense of the provinces monstrous debt.  On the one hand, yes, these children are under-equipped to handle the basic calculations they may encounter outside of school as well as the more difficult problems theyll see in higher grades, said Education Minister Mitzie Hunter. But on the other hand, they are more than equipped to not understand what it means for Ontario to owe 300 billion dollars, and thus be the worlds most indebted sub-sovereign borrower.  Plus, there is absolutely no way they could understand how abysmal our deficit spending plan is.  The test, whose math component included questions on volume, fraction arithmetic and the cancelled Ontario Retirement Pension Plan, was designed to measure students aptitude in math, reading and writing, as well as how effectively they use all three to understand the Wynne governments fiscal record. Luckily, the Premier said, they did not.  Im so, so proud of our children. Not only do they lack the skills to compare the magnitudes of dollar amounts and to interpret debt-vs-time graphs, but their subpar performance on division questions means they will not be able to burden themselves with the correct knowledge of our increasing debt-to-GDP ratio.  When asked about the fifty percent of students who did well, Wynne added, Theres more than enough time before their next EQAO test to ensure they satisfy the provincial standard of complacency with questionable spending practices."

You see, in reality, the Kochs WILL end up funding one of the 2 main party candidates, either Trump or Clinton. If Trump can ensure they do NOT support the Clinton campaign, he can effectively deprive her of billions while securing some for himself.    But thats not all. Unlike normal politicians, Donald Trump is not coming into the meeting absolutely NEEDING their cash. In fact, he has more than enough of his own to whoop Hillary Clinton back to 1967! This gives him what professional negotiators call a Power Position.  See, his popular support amongst the people and his own money mean that the Kochs NEED HIM if they want to maintain their corrupt empire and vast fortune. Since its not mutual, how could they say no?  So I am proud to see Donald Trump leveraging his position to build a war chest so MASSIVE that all the Clinton media ties in the world will not be able to stop the infinite momentum of the Trump Train."
155,Fake,"BREAKING  Rand Paul Stands Up For TRUMP, Says What All Of Us Were Thinking The 2016 GOP nominating was definitely a slugfest. While Rand Paul would have made a decent nominee, he came out in support of a major policy of the man whos been called upon to lead our nation.  Lets not give in to Washington and its stagnated ways. Lets follow the lead of Presidents Reagan and Bush and help President Trump begin his administration with tax cuts for everyone and less money in Washington, Paul wrote in an op-ed for Breitbart.  We have tried it before, Paul wrote. In fact, the most successful Republican presidents (and a few Democrats) led off their agendas with tax cuts to send money back and to try to get government to live with a little less.  Indeed, there have been two men who have shown how well tax cuts can play a role in stimulating our economy. These men were Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy.  When we elected the youthful Kennedy to become our 35th president, he had little economic experience, and the nation was still in the doldrums of a recession in 1958 that rivaled the one of 2008. He set out to determine how to get the country back on track.  As Lawrence Kudlow and Brian Domitrovic wrote in Time, in Kennedys first year in office, he at first tried the typical Democrat approach and instilled a number of spending approaches. However, growth was only at a stagnant 2.7 percent. He then had a change of heart and decided to push through a generous tax cut of 30 percent.  Although Kennedy never saw it to fruition before he was assassinated, LBJ decided to push it through as a memorial to the fallen leader. The tax cut became law in 1964, and it started an uninterrupted run of eight years of consistent economic growth of at least five percent annually.  One of Kennedys other successors was a man named Ronald Reagan, who was intrigued by the Kennedy model of tax cuts. He devised his own plan, and it passed the Senate by a 97-3 vote in 1986. The nation enjoyed a long-term growth rate of roughly four percent per year.  In 2016, the economy is not completely bleak, but it could be much better. The nation has had stagnant growth for much of the last two presidents terms, but as Rand Paul noted, even when George W. Bush attempted a modest tax cut, it gave the nation a boost for a period of time.  In standing with Donald Trumps ambitious tax cut plans, Rand Paul is staying true to himself and to this model. Trump has proven so far that he is a person of his word, and his proposed tax cuts would give this country the prosperity it so richly deserves.  If Trump doesnt follow through and it is just a read my lips moment, he will probably be a one-term president. He has Pauls support, so hopefully we can get America back on the right path to making it, once more, Great Again."
156,Real,"Israel claims ""ironclad"" proof that the Obama administration was behind U.N. rebuke JERUSALEM - Doubling down on its public break with the Obama administration, a furious Israeli government on Tuesday said it had received ironclad information from Arab sources that Washington actively helped craft last weeks U.N. resolution declaring Israeli settlements illegal.  The allegations further poisoned the increasingly toxic atmosphere between Israel and the outgoing Obama administration in the wake of Fridays vote, and raised questions about whether the White House might take further action against Israeli settlements in its final weeks in office.  With the U.S. expected to participate in an international peace conference in France next month and Secretary of State John Kerry planning a final policy speech, the Palestinians said they were hoping to capitalize on the momentum from the Security Council vote.  The U.N. vote's impact on U.S.-Israel relations Play VIDEO The U.N. vote's impact on U.S.-Israel relations Although the U.S. has long opposed Israeli settlements on occupied lands, it has traditionally used its veto in the U.N. Security Council to protect its ally Israel from international censure. But in a change of policy, it abstained from Fridays vote, allowing the resolution to pass by a 14-0 margin.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has long had a cool relationship with President Barack Obama, has called the resolution shameful and accused the U.S. of playing a leading role in its passage.  On Tuesday, his spokesman went even further.  We have ironclad information that emanates from sources in the Arab world and that shows the Obama administration helped craft this resolution and pushed hard for its eventual passage, David Keyes said.  Were not just going to be a punching bag and go quietly into the night as the Obama administration helps push such a grave resolution, he said.  How U.N. resolution against Israel will impact U.S. relations Play VIDEO How U.N. resolution against Israel will impact U.S. relations He did not identify the Arab sources or say how Israel obtained the information. Israel has close security ties with Egypt, an original sponsor of last weeks resolution. Under heavy Israeli pressure, Egypt delayed the resolution last week before other council members presented it for a vote a day later. Egypt ended up voting in favor of the measure.  Keyes claim mirrors that of his boss Netanyahu, who told his Cabinet on Sunday: From the information that we have, we have no doubt that the Obama Administration initiated it, stood behind it, coordinated on the wording and demanded that it be passed.  Netanyahu insists that there is nothing wrong with his controversial policy of building Jewish towns in occupied areas that the Palestinians, with overwhelming world support, claim for their state.  U.S. Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power defended the U.S. abstention, saying, We would not have let this resolution pass if it hadnt addressed counterproductive steps by the Palestinians. And she added that the vote does not in any way diminish the United States steadfast and unparalleled commitment to the security of Israel.  Power also warned that settlements make it harder to negotiate a separate Palestinian state, which the administration believes is crucial to a lasting peace, CBS News Margaret Brennan reports.  The United States has been sending a message that the settlements must stop, privately and publicly, for nearly five decades, Power said.  Israels recent diplomatic defeat would be much more damaging if not for a potential remaining and rather major ace in Netanyahus hand: the incoming Trump Administration.  In a striking departure from past policy of incumbent presidents waiting on the sidelines, Trump tried to scuttle the resolution and called for a U.S. veto. After the vote, Trump vowed that things will be different after Jan. 20th.  Critically, he has appointed an outspoken supporter and donor to the settlements, his longtime attorney David Friedman, as ambassador to Israel. And aides say Trump is serious about a promise to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which even many Israelis fear could spark violence. The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, home to sensitive religious sites, as the capital of the future state to which they aspire.  After Fridays vote, Netanyahus office said he looked forward to working with Trump to negate the harmful effects of this absurd resolution.  It remains unclear what Trump might be able to do. While he will be able to wield the U.S. veto to prevent further action against Israel in the council, mustering enough votes to overturn Fridays decision appears to be impossible.  The basis for the resolution is found in the Geneva conventions, which forbid the settling of areas captured in war from another country. Israel has said the law doesnt apply because the territory was captured from Jordan, which has renounced all claims to the land. Israel has also defended the occupation on religious and security grounds.  When Netanyahus rivals in Israel oppose the settlements, it is not necessarily due to a conviction that could be peace could be at hand, but rather for concern for Israels democracy. If Israel becomes inseparable from the West Bank, it will have to grant its 2.5 million Palestinians voting rights, or increasingly be unable to call itself a democracy.  The country is toxically divided on the issue, and key sectors of society, including intellectual elites and much of its security establishment, want to see settlements end. Many of them welcome - some openly, and many more quietly - any world pressure to bring that about.  Dan Miodownik, a professor of political science and international relations at Hebrew University, said there were actually some positive elements for Israel in the resolution.  He said it endorsed the idea of territorial swaps, meaning that Israel could keep some settlements as part of a negotiated peace deal. And the differentiation between Israel proper and the settlements signaled that unlike in the past, Israel was no longer being forced to defend its right to exist."
