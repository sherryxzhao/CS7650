0,Real,"Trump sons distance themselves from fundraiser After reports that Donald Trumps adult sons were listed as directors for a nonprofit offering inauguration weekend access to the president-elect, the Trump campaign pushed back on claims of their involvement in the organization.  The Center for Public Integrity reviewed filing documents for the Opening Day Foundation, a Texas nonprofit formed on Dec. 14 that says its dedicated to preserving the great outdoors. In a draft invitiation to the event, billed as Opening Day 2017, donors giving at least $500,000 to the nonprofit were promised a private reception and photo opportunity with Mr. Trump as well as a multi-day hunting and/or fishing excursion with Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.  Donald Trump's wealthy group of Cabinet picks Play VIDEO Donald Trump's wealthy group of Cabinet picks Opening Day is your opportunity to play a significant role as our family commemorates the inauguration of our father, friend and President Donald J. Trump. Join us as we celebrate the great American tradition of outdoor sporting, shooting, fishing and conservation, reads a draft of the invitation, first obtained by TMZ. The draft invitation also listed Mr. Trumps two adult sons as honorary co-chairmen of the event.  But Tuesday afternoon, Trump transition spokeswoman Hope Hicks denied the involvement of Mr. Trumps sons.  The Opening Day event and details that have been reported are merely initial concepts that have not been approved or pursued by the Trump family, said Hicks in a statement. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump are avid outdoorsmen and supporters of conservation efforts, which align with the goals of this event, however they are not involved in any capacity.  In a call with reporters Wednesday, the transition team repeated that the Trump sons would have no involvement with the event itself.  According to the New York Times, the event is still scheduled, but references to the hunting trip have been removed.  The Camouflage & Cufflinks-themed evening will still be held at a convention center in Washington, D.C. on January 21, the day following Mr. Trumps inauguration to the White House.  Ivanka Trump takes fire for hawking $10,800 bracelet worn on 60 Minutes Two of the four directors of the Opening Day Foundation, Dallas hedge fund manager Gentry Beach and Tom Hicks Jr., the son of a Texas billionaire, were fundraisers for the Trump campaign and are close to Donald Trump Jr, according to local news reports. But soon after the Center for Public Integrity found that the Opening Day Foundations nonprofit registration papers also listed Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump as directors of the organization, a spokeswoman for the president-elect released a statement disavowing the participation of the Trumps.  A spokeswoman for the Texas secretary of state told the Washington Post Wednesday that new paperwork had been filed to remove the Trump sons from the Opening Day Foundation leadership."

""Before this year ends, I want to thank you again for your support of our campaign,"" Clinton wrote in the email. ""While we didn't achieve the outcome we sought, I'm proud of the vision and values we fought for and the nearly 66 million people who voted for them.""

2,Real,"Labor Secretary Tom Perez: Trump transition probes illegal Labor Secretary Tom Perez called presidential transition questions sent to government agencies like the Energy department, seeking to identify employees who worked on climate change, against the law.  Those questions have no place in a transition, Perez said. That is illegal.  DNC prepares to pick its next leader Last week, President-elect Trumps transition team sent the State Department a memo requesting information on its gender-related staffing, programming, and funding. However, the document did not request specific names of employees working on those programs.  Will dedicated career people be targeted because they were doing the right work? Perez said.  He said he isnt aware of any similar blanket questions posed to the Labor Department.  The president-elects transition team responded to Perezs comments in statement saying the transition has a memorandum of understanding in place with the administration, and we continue to uphold both of our ends in this agreement.  President-elect Trump has nominated businessman Andy Puzder to replace Perez as head of the Labor Department. Puzder is CEO of CKE restaurants which owns the fast food chains Hardees and Carls Jr. He has argued against raising the minimum wage.  Perez is now running for Chair of the Democratic National Committee. He criticized the Democratic Party for neglecting Rust Belt states, where Mr. Trump trounced Hillary Clinton.  Organizing cant consist of going to a church every four years in October and saying vote for me, Perez said.  President Obama nominated Perez as Labor Secretary in 2013. Perez championed Mr. Obamas efforts to expand overtime pay to millions of Americans. A Texas judge blocked a Labor Department rule expanding overtime in November. But Perez is promising to focus on similar efforts if elected DNC Chair.  You dont have to lower wages in order to move forward. You can lift wages and lift prosperity for everybody.  Perez faces Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellisona favorite of some progressives, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermonts Sen. Bernie Sanders (I). Other names of potential DNC Chair challengers are also being floated.  Ellison is pushing to strengthen what he calls the grassroots of the party.  We have got to just make sure the Democratic rank-and-file really owns the party, feels that it is theirs, Ellison told Face the Nation moderator John Dickerson.  Ellison has promised to work as DNC Chair full-time, resigning from Congress, if elected.  Perez, too, vowed to work full-time as DNC Chair, saying hed put aside a possible run for Governor of Maryland challenging popular Republican incumbent Larry Hogan."
3,Real,"Which candidates did the seven ""faithless"" electors support? A historic number of faithless electors -- seven in total--each cast their ballots on Monday for a candidate other than the one who won his or her state. What may be more surprising, given the level of protests against Donald Trump and the pressure exerted on Republican electors, is that a greater number were untrue to Hillary Clinton than to Mr. Trump.  Among the 538 electors chosen to represent their states in the Electoral College, five were faithless to the Democratic nominee and two to the Republican. Prior to this year, there hasnt been more than one faithless elector in any presidential election since 1948.  What is next for the Electoral College? Among the Democratic faithless electors was David Mulinix, of Hawaii, who cast his vote for Bernie Sanders instead of Hillary Clinton. He said he believes the Electoral College is outdated, according to Hawaii News Now, which also pointed out that though Hawaii forbids faithless electors, Mulinixs vote still counted and he would face no punishment because Hawaii has never bothered to come up with a penalty for breaking the law.  Four of the faithless electors came from Washington, a state won by Clinton. Three of them--Bret Chiafalo, 19-year-old Levi Guerra, and Esther John-- cast their votes for former Secretary of State Colin Powell, according to the Seattle Times. They also participated in a movement started by Chiafalo. The so-called Hamilton Electors base their ideology on Alexander Hamilton--one of the Founding Fathers who wrote about the Electoral College in the Federalist Papers.  The fourth faithless elector, Robert Satiacum, voted for Faith Spotted Eagle--a woman who is a member of the Yankton Sioux Nation, according to a local NBC affiliate. She played a public role in opposing the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines.  President-elect Trump lost Texas elector Christopher Suprun to John Kasich. Another Texas elector, Bill Greene, voted for Libertarian Ron Paul, according to the Texas Monthly.  Though there is no Constitutional provision or federal law barring electors from voting for whom they are pledged, more than half of the states, including D.C., bind their electors. The rest of electors may have the legal authority to vote for whomever they want, but, as CBS News previously reported, faithless electors have never decided a presidential election.  The entire procedure lasted well into the evening, with the official tally coming in around 8 p.m--though the president-elect clinched the nomination with the necessary 270 votes earlier in the evening. According to a final tally, Trump received 304 votes compared to Clintons 227.  The votes cast Monday will be sent on to the nations capital by late December. Subsequently, on Jan. 6, Vice President Joe Biden will open the electoral votes before a joint session of the new Congress, where they will be counted one last time."
4,Real,"Donald Trump accuses President Obama of ""roadblocks"" during transition President-elect Donald Trump escalated his rhetoric against President Obama on Wednesday, accusing the current president of roadblocks leading up to Inauguration Day.  In a tweet Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump said he was doing [his] best to disregard the inflammatory  statements and roadblocks from Mr. Obama:  Mr. Trump was presumably still responding to Mr. Obamas comments in a podcast interview released Monday, in which he said he would have been able to mobilize Americans against Mr. Trump had he been able to run for a third term in 2016.  I am confident in this vision because Im confident that if I had run again and articulated it, I think I couldve mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it, Mr. Obama said in the interview with David Axelrod, his former senior political advisor, which was released on Axelrods podcast AxeFiles. I know that in conversations that Ive had with people around the country, even some people who disagreed with me, they would say the vision, the direction that you point towards is the right one.  These comments appear to have gotten under Mr. Trumps skin: Wednesdays tweet is the third in three days about Mr. Obama.  On Monday, Mr. Trump tweeted that there is NO WAY Mr. Obama could have defeated him if he had been able to run for a third term this year:  And on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said Mr. Obama campaigned hard (and personally) in the very important swing states, and lost:  Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama seemed to move past the scathing campaign trail rhetoric in the weeks immediately following Election Day, talking by phone on several occasions and speaking in positive terms about their interactions.  In a meeting with The New York Times in November, Mr. Trump described his great meeting with Mr. Obama. I didnt know if Id like him, Mr. Trump said. I probably thought that maybe I wouldnt, but I did. I really enjoyed him a lot.  But as Inauguration Day approaches, it appears that goodwill is not going to last. Mr. Trump has been critical of several of Mr. Obamas recent decisions, including the abstention on the United Nations Security Council vote condemning Israeli settlements.  Mr. Obama, too, has offered veiled criticisms of Mr. Trump in recent public speeches and appearances. For example, speaking aside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Pearl Harbor on Tuesday, Mr. Obama said that even when hatred burns hottest, even when the tug of tribalism is at its most primal, we must resist the urge to turn inward. We must resist the urge to demonize those who are different."
5,Real,"What the intelligence briefing says about Obama's presidency  and Trump's WASHINGTON  The very first President's Intelligence Checklist  the predecessor to what's now known as the President's Daily Briefing  was delivered to President John F. Kennedy on a June Saturday in 1961. Typewritten on eight pages of 8.5-by-8-inch paper and stamped ""For the President Only  Top Secret,"" it contained 14 two-sentence briefs culled from diplomatic, military, intelligence and press sources, six shorter notes, and maps of Laos and the Congo.  Today, President Obama receives the document on an iPad. The articles are somewhat longer and sometimes have dissenting opinions. The maps can be interactive, and the briefings can include video.  The differences aren't just technological. After serving 10 presidents  and now preparing to brief the 11th, President-elect Donald Trump  the President's Daily Briefing has had to adjust to the reading habits and decision-making styles of each commander in chief.  And the ways in which it's produced, read and discussed provide a rare insight into how presidents approach national security issues.  ""Its the only standing meeting he has every day. Even if we dont have the meeting, he gets the document,"" said Obama's deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes. ""Everyday there's the possibility that he'll see something that will cause him to move the entire U.S. government in a new direction. There's nothing else like that.""  For Obama, the PDB process paints a portrait of a methodical president who's often disdainful of raw, unfiltered intelligence in favor of more analytical perspective. He encourages dissenting opinions. He's interested in ""open source"" intelligence  including press accounts and, increasingly, social media  in addition to old-fashioned spycraft and intercepted communications.  President-elect Trump has yet to make a formal mark on intelligence. He's still getting a daily intelligence briefing designed for, and catered to, Obama. He's reading it largely as a courtesy by the incumbent president, part of a bipartisan tradition dating back to President Harry Truman.  But Trump has already suggested a different style of receiving intelligence. For the first month, he received in-person intelligence briefings only once a week, although his transition team now says it's three times a week.  But Trump himself has suggested a more ad hoc system of being updated only when major developments warrant.  ""I get it when I need it,"" Trump told Fox News Sunday.  ""I don't have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years,"" he said. ""I don't need that. But I do say, 'If something should change, let us know.' ""  In skipping daily briefings, Trump shows ambivalence toward intel agencies Aides: Trump gets frequent classified briefings Obama has said much the same about his daily briefing  albeit much later in his presidency.  ""Over the years, you accumulate knowledge,"" Obama said in a YouTube interview earlier this year. ""Now, I've got enough of a baseline of knowledge. I've seen problems come up before, I've seen patterns that have emerged. I might not have to go into the briefing book as deeply as I did. ... I'm skimming. I'm looking at, are there significant differences?""  The frequency, the duration, the format, the depth, the subject matter  even the distribution list  are all up to the president.  In a book published earlier this year, former CIA officer David Priess argued that the PDB has had to adapt to each president who has receives it  and will continue to evolve to meet the president's personality, learning style and priorities.  ""If a new president comes in and he wants the PDB presented through interpretive dance, he or she will get that,"" said Priess, author of The President's Book of Secrets: The Untold Story of Intelligence Briefings. ""There will be a whole lot of intelligence officers taking dancing lessons.""  The President's Daily Briefing is what its name implies, Priess said.  ""It is brief. Everything is not going to make it in. Its daily. If its not breaking, or not current, it doesnt get in,"" he said. ""But the most important word is 'president.' Is this deserving of his attention?""  That's a question that the intelligence community is constantly trying to reassess. And the transition period is a critical time for the incoming president to get up to speed on intelligence issues  and for the intelligence community to get to know the president-elect.  Current and former national security officials say frequent, in-person briefings with the president  and the president-elect  are an essential part of making sure the commander in chief is well-informed.  ""There is a certain amount of trial and error to really settle in to what the new team wants,"" former CIA director Michael Hayden said. In his book, Playing to the Edge: American Intelligence in the Age of Terror, he describes what the intelligence community crudely refers to as the ""aw, s---"" moment.  Michael Hayden is a retired Air Force four-star general, Michael Hayden is a retired Air Force four-star general, former director of the National Security Agency and former director of the CIA. (Photo: Jasper Colt, USA TODAY) It's attempt by intelligence officials to challenge the worldview of the president-elect's political advisers with a dose of reality. Hayden calls it ""phenomenon of the unpleasant fact.""  ""That's when the intelligence guys give the president information and analysis that cuts across the policy or politics grain of the administration. You're telling them something they dont want to hear and dont want to believe,"" he said.  And it's important to do that in an in-person briefing, as opposed to the written product. ""You have to shake the preferred narrative of the policymaker,"" Hayden said. ""And you need the ability to do that face to face, and to do it with your tone, and your words and your body language to communicate, as opposed to just throwing it over the transom.""  When Obama first took office, the intelligence community grumbled that Obama  or at least his national security staff  wanted the reports so brief that they called them ""PDB haiku.""  Hayden's early briefings of Obama (he was replaced three weeks into Obama's presidency) were ""far less tactical"" than the briefings President George W. Bush was receiving.  But Michael Leiter, who directed the National Counterterrorism Center under both Bush and Obama, said he saw Obama grow in his use of intelligence from those early months.  ""His inclination from the start was less about the tactics and more about the strategy, and more about how the U.S. was perceived in the world and interacted in the world,"" he said.  ""But there certainly was an evolution. To me, that was most crystallized, around the time of underwear bomber,"" he said, referring to the Christmas Day 2009 plot to bring down a Detroit-bound airliner. ""That so changed the president's perception of how detail oriented he had to be on these things.""  From then on, he said, any terrorism threat the president was briefed about also had to include an operational briefing about what was being done to address it.  Still, it's a difficult balancing act for the president and his briefing team. Rhodes said the president needs to be disciplined enough not to be distracted by the uncorroborated bits of information  or to attribute more credibility to information only because it's classified. ""Sometimes you are so focused on what is secret that you're not looking at what's right in front of your eyes,"" Rhodes said in an interview with USA TODAY before the election.  ""Its worrisome to get into raw intelligence,"" he said. ""Because you may have some intercept that you think is great, but it could be some official in some country, it could be just their view, or what they hope happens. Or, sometimes they know that the (National Security Agency) is listening, and they want us to intercept that raw intelligence. That's where the job of ODNI is very hard.""  Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communication Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communication Ben Rhodes (Photo: Mandel Ngan, AFP/Getty Images) ODNI is the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, an office created by Congress in 2004 in a series of post-9/11 intelligence reforms. While the briefing is assembled by ODNI with input from the entire intelligence community, the CIA  by virtue of its historic role and experience in analysis  still has an outsized role in the process.  Obama has said he's conscientious about hearing from a broad array of experts. ""I've learned to be pretty good at listening carefully to people who know a lot more than I do about a topic,"" Obama said in the YouTube interview. ""And taking sure that any dissenting voices are in the same room at the same time.""  But while Obama says he listens to all voices, not all of those voices feel that they're being heard.  A 2014 report from the Intelligence Community Inspector General interviewed intelligence analysts across the government and found that ""broader community participation in the President's Daily Brief (PDB) remains a challenge.""  Rhodes said the president has increasingly asked for lower-level analysts who are experts in a political topic to brief him personally  a practice that has been going on at least since Jimmy Carter's presidency. ""Let's get the analysts who are living through these issues every day,"" Rhodes said. ""He likes that, so he's tried to do that more.""  The daily book often contains dissenting views, which Leiter said were ""often the most illuminating thing in a PDB article.""  And under Obama, non-urgent raw intelligence often gets shopped around the intelligence community for corroboration and analysis before making it to the president. And highly sensitive information gleaned from top-secret sources and methods is balanced with open-source intelligence  the kind of information that's available to anyone reading a newspaper.  'Rebalancing' the PDB  Presidents, of course, also send signals back to the intelligence community about their policy priorities  and that gets reflected in their briefings.  Richard Nixon's had a heavy emphasis on Vietnam and China. Ronald Reagan's was almost singularly obsessed with the Soviet Union. And for the last two presidents, the Middle East has dominated the PDB  to the extent that the White House has occasionally had to remind intelligence agencies that Obama wants a wider aperture.  ""You could write the PDB every day and never talk about anything except the Middle East and Russia,"" Rhodes said. ""To the point where weve had to say, 'Hey, guys, we're rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific. Make sure that's represented in the PDB.' You almost have to reach out for that stuff, because it doesn't always naturally come up.""  Obama's PDB also increasingly includes information on economic, environmental and public health crises that could have an impact on national security. And they're not necessarily confined to foreign affairs. Last summer, deputy press secretary Eric Schultz confirmed that Obama had been briefed on the spread of the Zika virus in Florida as part of his daily intelligence briefing.

(Photo: Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images) World's most exclusive newspaper  The President's Daily Briefing, also known as ""the book,"" is among the most secret documents the government keeps. For a time, even its very existence was thought to be classified.  It's just one of dozens of products regularly produced by the intelligence community. But because it gets the attention of the commander in chief, it has a sense of urgency and importance  and even mystique  that other top secret documents don't have.  ""Today it is such a vital part of how the White House operates that one can hardly imagine the modern presidency without it,"" said CIA Director John Brennan as the agency declassified 2,500 briefings to Presidents Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson last year. ""The PDB is the most abundantly staffed, most deeply sourced daily information service in the world.""  It's been referred to as the world's most exclusive daily newspaper, written exclusively for the president of the United States.  But presidents can and do share the PDB with a small circle of advisers.  Kennedy never shared his with his vice president. Nixon deeply distrusted the CIA and often ignored the briefing, instead delegating it to national security adviser Henry Kissinger.  The younger Bush restricted the distribution to just six or seven people. In the Obama administration, the distribution list is thought to be as many as two dozen, including the secretary of State. In her book Hard Choices, Clinton called the hand-delivered report the ""first order of business"" after getting to the office each morning. Her schedules, released under the Freedom of Information Act, often allotted the first five minutes of every morning to reading the PDB.  The president could even share the briefing with members of his family. Trump and his family have denied reports that he's sought security clearances for his children and for son-in-law Jared Kushner, but the president is the ultimate authority on how classified information can be shared and with whom.  Trump has also raised eyebrows by appearing to question the CIA's integrity in the wake of reports that the spy agency had concluded that Russia deliberately interfered in the election to get Trump elected. ""These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,"" the Trump transition said in a statement to reporters last week.  That prompted the White House to defend the intelligence officers  and suggest that Trump would do well to listen to them.  ""President Obamas experience over the last eight years has been that the men and women of the intelligence community in the United States are patriots,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Monday. ""President Obama is certainly not the first president to have enjoyed the benefits of the experts in our intelligence community, and I'm confident the president-elect would benefit from that advice if he remains open to it."""
6,Real,"Intelligence Agencies Distressed by Trump's Rejection of Findings on Russia President-elect Donald Trump's dismissal of U.S. intelligence findings that Russia tried to sway the presidential election is a distressing slap in the face to the intelligence community, current and former U.S. intelligence officials said Sunday.  Trump on Sunday repeated his rejection of the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia actively worked to help him win the election, calling the idea ""ridiculous"" in an interview on ""Fox News Sunday.""  The comment, like others that Trump made during the campaign, ""is contrary to all that is sacred to national security professionals who work day and night to protect this country,"" a U.S. intelligence official told NBC News.  Play'There Needs to Be a Sense of Trust' Between Trump and Spy Agencies, Ex-FBI Official Says Facebook Twitter Google Plus Embed 'There Needs to Be a Sense of Trust' Between Trump and Spy Agencies, Ex-FBI Official Says 6:45 The official called it ""concerning"" that the president-elect has chosen to ""impugn the integrity of U.S. intelligence officials"" by disputing professional intelligence judgments as false or politically partisan.  A congressional official with knowledge of the issue told NBC News on Saturday that the CIA has concluded that Russia mounted a covert intelligence operation to help Trump win the election.  Another source briefed on the intelligence told NBC News that the U.S. government has identified specific Russian actors it believes were involved in computer systems hacks  based on intercepted communications, human tips and computer forensics.  Donald Trump Dismisses Claims That Russia Interfered in 2016 Election 3:33 Trump dismissed such reports in a statement Friday that derided the CIA as ""the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.""  A former senior intelligence official also noted Trump's assertion Sunday on Fox News that he doesn't always take the Presidential Daily Briefing  the top-secret briefing on national security developments  because ""I'm, like, a smart person.""  ""It is curious that someone who refuses to take intelligence briefings has decided that he doesn't agree with the analysis contained in them,"" the former official said.  Trump's dispute of CIA 'troubling' 7:47 Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat the House Intelligence Committee, also blasted Trump, saying the integrity of the electoral process is called into question ""when President-elect Trump and his transition team minimize or dismiss the intelligence assessments themselves.""  ""Even more damaging are comments that impugn the tens of thousands of Americans who are at work every day of the year, many in great physical danger, to protect us and to provide our national leadership  regardless of political party  with the best information possible,"" Schiff said Saturday.  ""Perhaps, once he has taken office, Mr. Trump will go to the CIA and look at the rows of memorial stars in the lobby  each representing a fallen officer  and reflect on his disparagement of the intelligence community's work,"" he said."
7,Real,"Texas kicking Planned Parenthood out of Medicaid funding AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas has given Planned Parenthood final notice of plans to cut off Medicaid funding, a move that federal judges have so far blocked other Republican-controlled states from making.  Planned Parenthood responded Tuesday by saying it will also ask a court to stop Texas from defunding clinics in January. Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana and Kansas are among the states where judges have denied similar efforts.  People are donating to Planned Parenthood in Mike Pence's name Planned Parenthood had previously received $3.1 million in Medicaid funding from the state of Texas, according to the notice that was obtained by the Texas Tribune. Planned Parenthood says its clinics serve nearly 11,000 women in Texas each year through Medicaid.  Planned Parenthood will lose the Medicaid funding within 30 days. The organization has 15 days to appeal  by requesting an administrative hearing with the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, according to the Tribune.  Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards responded by calling Texas a cautionary tale for the rest of the nation. The move comes at a time when her organization is simultaneously fighting to stop Congress from also cutting off taxpayer dollars. President-elect Donald Trump has given mixed signals about his feelings toward the group.  Last week, the Obama administration barred states from denying federal family planning funds, although abortion opponents immediately said they would seek to repeal it when Mr. Trump takes office in January."
8,Real,"Poll: Majority of Americans Pessimistic or Uncertain About Trump Presidency As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to be sworn in as the country's commander-in-chief next month, a majority of Americans say they are either uncertain or pessimistic about his presidency, even as the country is sounding a more optimistic tone about the future of the economy and Trump's ability to bring positive change to Washington D.C.  A new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll finds 54 percent of adults saying that they are either uncertain (25 percent) or pessimistic and worried (29 percent) about how Trump will perform during his presidency, compared with 45 percent with either an optimistic and confident view (22 percent) or a satisfied and hopeful view (23 percent).  That's a significantly worse outlook than Americans expressed after the elections of both Barack Obama and George W. Bush. A combined 66 percent were either optimistic or hopeful about Obama in January 2009, according to the same poll, while 59 percent were optimistic or hopeful about George W. Bush in January 2001.   The data show the extent to which the nation remains unusually divided even though Election Day is in the rearview mirror, said Democratic pollster Fred Yang of Hart Research Associates, which conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff and his firm Public Opinion Strategies.  ""Usually elections settle arguments and the nation comes together, at least in the short term,"" Yang said. ""Today, hard feelings persist on both sides of the partisan divide. It's as if the 2016 campaign has never ended.""  Those partisan differences are particularly stark when it comes to public approval ratings of the way Trump is handling his transition. Half of the country overall gives Trump high marks so far, compared to 41 percent who give him a thumbs down. But among Hillary Clinton's voters, only 12 percent approve of how he's handling the transition, compared to 92 percent of Trump voters.  Back in 2008, 50 percent of John McCain's voters approved of Barack Obama's handling of his presidential transition, and in 1992, 63 percent of George H.W. Bush's voters backed Bill Clinton's early moves as president-elect.   The partisan divide extends to views about the men and women Trump has selected to lead his administration. Seventy-eight percent of Democrats say they are disappointed with the administration appointments Trump has made so far, while 80 percent of Republicans say they are generally pleased with Trump's picks.  While Trump's overall favorability has ticked up modestly since before the election, he remains underwater, with more Americans giving him a poor rating (46 percent) than a positive one (40 percent.)  That marks the first time that an incoming president has been viewed more negatively than positively in the history of the NBC/WSJ poll.  Some bright spots -- but ones mostly driven by enthusiasm from Trump's supporters  While the public is largely apprehensive about the president-elect, Americans do say that they are more optimistic that the U.S. economy will improve in the next year. Forty-two percent say they believe the economy will get better - the highest share since autumn of 2012 -- while only 19 percent say the economy will get worse in the next year.  Trump has also generated relatively positive feelings about his ability to change the federal government for the better. A majority of Americans say Trump will shake up the way government operates - and, among that group, they believe that he'll bring the right kind of change by a two-to-one margin (41 percent to 20 percent).  Additionally, a majority - fifty-six percent - say they are optimistic that Trump will keep U.S. jobs from going overseas.   Still, the confidence about Trump's presidency is mostly fueled by enthusiasm among his base voters rather than by more hopeful expectations among those who didn't choose him on their ballot in November.  A whopping 92 percent of Trump voters are optimistic about his ability to bring change to Washington, while just 20 percent of Clinton voters say the same. The same share of Trump voters - 92 percent - say they are hopeful that Trump will look out for those who are struggling in today's economy, while only nine percent of Clinton voters agree.   Those who say that the economy will get better in the next year rather than worse include key Trump constituency groups like whites (49 percent better compared to 15 percent worse), Republicans (68 percent better to six percent worse), and men (46 percent better to 15 percent worse.) Among Democrats, 33 percent believe the economy will get worse compared to 19 percent who believe it will improve, and just 22 percent of African Americans think the economy will improve compared to a third who say it will deteriorate.  The public also still harbors concerns about Trump's temperament. Just 36 percent of Americans say they are optimistic that Trump has the right temperament to be president, while 44 percent say they are worried about the issue.  The Republican Party gets a boost - but will it last?  In the wake of the 2016 election, the Republican Party now has a higher net favorability rating (35 percent positive, 38 percent negative) than the Democratic Party (34 percent positive, 42 percent negative). That's the first time since after the 2010 midterms that Republicans have scored better on the favorability measure than their Democratic counterparts.  But it's not clear that Americans' warmer feelings toward the GOP will endure. After its previous high watermark six years ago, the party's positive ratings quickly fell back to earth, with Democrats regaining the advantage the following month."
9,Real,"Lawyer: 'Appalled' by FBI warrant that shook Clinton WASHINGTON  The FBI warrant that shook Hillary Clintons 2016 presidential campaign in its final two weeks has been unsealed, and the lawyer who requested it says it offers ""nothing at all"" to merit the agency's actions leading up to the Nov. 8 election.  The warrant was released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by Los Angeles lawyer Randy Schoenberg, who wants to determine what probable cause the agency provided to suspect material on disgraced congressman Anthony Weiners computer might be incriminating to Clinton. Weiner is the estranged husband of Clintons top aide, Huma Abedin. Under the Fourth Amendment, search and seizure can only be granted when proof of probable cause of criminal findings has been documented.  The letter confirms news reports in late October that the FBI had detected non-content header information suggesting correspondence with accounts involved in its already-completed investigation of Clinton's private email server. The FBI request concludes there is probable cause to believe that the laptop contained evidence, contraband, fruits and/or items illegally possessed, without providing specifics.  ""I see nothing at all in the search warrant application that would give rise to probable cause, nothing that would make anyone suspect that there was anything on the laptop beyond what the FBI had already searched and determined not to be evidence of a crime, nothing to suggest that there would be anything other than routine correspondence between"" Clinton and Abedin, Schoenberg said in an email to USA TODAY. It remains unknown ""why they thought they might find evidence of a crime, why they felt it necessary to inform Congress, and why they even sought this search warrant,"" he said. ""I am appalled."" The FBI's Manhattan office did not immediately return a call seeking comment.  Clinton campaign officials echoed Schoenberg's complaints Tuesday. Campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said on Twitter that the ""unsealed filings regarding Huma's emails reveals Comey's intrusion on the election was as utterly unjustified as we suspected at time.""  Read more:  New emails under review in Clinton case emerged from Weiner probe FBI declares it is finally done investigating Hillary Clinton's email The FBI concluded in July that there was no clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws and that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case. Then, two weeks before the election, Comey sent a three-paragraph letter to Congress that said in the course of an unrelated investigation investigators found emails that appear to be pertinent to Clintons private email server. Comey also wrote that he could not assess whether the material was significant.  The letter was so vague that Clintons opponents seized on it to shift the narrative from a damaging drumbeat of news stories about Donald Trump, including his past treatment of women. Trump called it bigger than Watergate and predicted that the FBI would ""right the ship"" after previously deciding against criminal charges.  Comeys investigation was the primary cudgel for Trump and his supporters, who claimed  falsely  that Clinton was guilty of criminal activity. His large rallies regularly chanted Lock her up! and Clintons motorcade was greeted in city after city with angry crowds waving signs.

(Photo: Matt Rourke, AP) Abedins lawyers have also been requesting permission to review the warrant, which they say their client never saw and hadnt or even been alerted to, preventing them from responding publicly in the final days of the campaign. Two days before the election, Comey confirmed there was no new information.  At the same time, Comey was in possession of evidence showing Russia was hacking into the Democratic Party apparatus, and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., accused him of holding back explosive information about Russian interference. The retiring senator said Comey may have violated the Hatch Act, which prohibits activity directed towards the success or failure of a candidate.  On Monday, former president Bill Clinton said his wife fought through everything, and she prevailed against it all. But she couldnt endure the combination of the FBIs interference and Russian meddling. At the end, we had the Russians and the FBI deal. But she couldnt prevail against that, Clinton told reporters in Albany.

Yet the election was decided by the smallest of margins in a handful of Rust Belt states. Nate Silver, a leading elections statistician and editor-in-chief of FiveThirtyEight, says Comey had a large, measurable impact on the race"" and that she would almost certainly be president-elect if the election had been held the day before the letter. He cited late-deciding voters breaking strongly against her enough to cost her Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.  Schoenberg said more information needs to be made public before the matter is put to rest. ""The FBI agents name has not been disclosed, but I think that it may be appropriate to find out his/her name and determine what the motivations were, since it must have been obvious to the FBI that there was no real probable cause to believe they would find evidence of a crime,"" he said in a follow-up email.  ""It was very wrong for Director Comey to give that impression.""  Schoenberg is a lawyer who gained notoriety by reclaiming Jewish-owned art seized by the Nazis and former president of the Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust."
10,Real,"Michelle Obama: Presidential Election Was 'Challenging' to Watch Michelle Obama in a candid interview with Oprah Winfrey opened up for the first time publicly about the 2016 presidential campaign, calling it ""challenging"" for her ""as a citizen to watch and experience.""  The first lady said it was important ""for the health of this nation"" that she and her husband, President Barack Obama, support President-elect Donald Trump, even though she said some political leaders didn't support her husband's presidency.  ""So we're going to be there for the next president and do whatever we have to do to make sure that he is successful, because if he succeeds, we all succeed,"" Obama told Winfrey during her final one-on-one White House interview, which aired Monday at 8 p.m. ET on CBS.  In the one-hour program, Obama reflected on her eight years as first lady, discussing topics including her surprise at being called an ""angry black woman"" during her husband's 2007 presidential campaign and Trump's comments about women.  ""For all the people out there, they have to understand that, as I've said time and time again, words matter,"" she said. ""And they matter most to our kids, our young people.

""Sixteen years, I wouldn't do that to my kids because what people don't understand is that you run, their lives stop, at any age,"" she said. ""The next family that comes in here, every person in that family, every child, every grandchild, their lives will be turned upside down in a way that no American really understands.""  Winfrey also asked about Trump's post-election visit to the White House.  ""It was very pleasant,"" she said. ""It was a wonderful visit because this is a really great job.""  Obama said she and Melania Trump talked about the kids and said she told the incoming first lady that her ""door is open"" for any questions.  ""My offer to Melania was you really don't know what you don't know until you're here, so the door is open as I've told her,"" Obama said, adding that she's modeling what the Bushes had done for her.  Obama also took time to reflect on her accomplishments, saying she thinks she moved the needle on childhood obesity and changed the conversation on how Americans look at the military.  President Barack Obama also made an appearance during the interview, discussing what surprised him about how his wife filled the role of first lady.  ""We all knew she was brilliant and cute and strong and a great mom,"" the president said.

Toward the end, Winfrey returned to a question she had put to Michelle Obama eight years earlier, when she asked about Obama's prayers for her family.  Obama's response at the time, Winfrey said, was that ""we remain whole.""  ""So now, I ask you, what is your prayer for our country?"" Winfrey continued.  ""It's hope,"" Obama replied.

11,Real,"After violence abroad, Trump meeting with security adviser PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President-elect Donald Trump is planning to meet with his incoming national security adviser in the aftermath of a rattling day of violence around the world.  Trump appeared to jump ahead of investigators in blaming Islamic terrorists for deadly incidents Monday in Turkey and Germany and vowing anew to eradicate their regional and global networks. He called the brazen shooting of Russias ambassador to Turkey a violation of all rules of civilized order. He added that a radical Islamic terrorist had assassinated the diplomat, Andrei Karlov.  Turkish authorities identified the gunman as Mevlut Mert Altintas, a member of Ankaras riot police squad, and said he was later killed in a shootout with police. Altintas shouted in Turkish about the Syrian city of Aleppo and also yelled Allahu akbar, Arabic for God is great.  President-elect Trump describes mission to fight terrorism As for Berlin, where at least 12 people were killed and nearly 50 hurt when a truck plowed through a Christmas market, Trump said the Islamic State group and other Islamist terrorists continually slaughter Christians in their communities and places of worship as part of their global jihad. A man held by German authorities after the violence was later released after a lack of evidence to connect him to the incident.  Trumps meeting scheduled Wednesday with retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn will come a day after Flynn and several other members of the incoming national security team met with Vice President-elect Mike Pence in Washington. Aides said the meeting was planned before the acts of violence, though they were discussed.  The gathering with Pence included retired Gen. John Kelly, Trumps nominee for head of the Department of Homeland Security; retired Gen. James Mattis, the pick for defense secretary; and Rex Tillerson, the head of Exxon Mobil and the intended nominee for secretary of state.  While Trump has assembled his Cabinet at a quick pace, the process to fill out top White House jobs has been slowed by infighting among advisers. Some of Trumps earliest advisers have expressed concern to the president-elect himself that they are getting boxed out in favor of those more closely aligned with incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus, who has chaired the Republican National Committee.  Among those whose future is still in flux is Corey Lewandowski, Trumps controversial first campaign manager who was fired after clashing with the president-elects family. On Monday, Lewandowski met with Jared Kushner, Trumps influential son-in-law, and could still be offered a job in the administration, though potentially one that would keep him out of the West Wing - and away from the president.  The president-elects transition team has said it expects to announce some White House positions in the coming days.  Former FBI agent on how Berlin terror attack differs from Nice Trump met Tuesday with candidates for his unfilled Cabinet positions, including prospective hires to run the Department of Veterans Affairs, a beleaguered agency that the Republican businessman has vowed to overhaul.  At Mar-a-Lago, Trumps palatial Florida estate, the president-elect met with Luis Quinonez, who runs a company with military and health care ties and is said to be under consideration for VA secretary. He also interviewed Toby Cosgrove, the CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, who was a top contender to replace Eric Shinseki when he resigned from the VA in 2014. Cosgrove later withdrew from consideration.  Trump repeatedly pledged during the campaign to fix the woes at the department and said he would take care of great veterans. But he also came under scrutiny for being slow in paying out money raised for veterans groups and for suggesting that strong veterans dont need treatment for mental health problems.  Others said to be considered for the post include former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, Florida Rep. Jeff Miller and Pete Hegseth, an Army veteran and former CEO of Concerned Veterans for America.  Trump is also considering Jovita Carranza, who worked in President George W. Bushs administration, as his choice for U.S. trade representative. She served as deputy administrator of the Small Business Administration under Bush.  With just a handful of Cabinet posts to fill, Trump is facing some criticism for a lack of diversity in his senior team, which currently includes no Hispanics. The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials said Tuesday that it was deeply concerned at the lack of Hispanics considered for top jobs. Carranza was a member of Trumps Hispanic advisory council during the campaign.  Pence, meanwhile, met in Washington with former Texas state official Susan Combs, who served both as state agriculture commissioner and comptroller. Trump also needs to fill the Agriculture Department slot. Transition officials did not immediately confirm if Combs is up for that post."
12,Real,"Preexisting Conditions and Republican Plans to Replace Obamacare As debate about Obamacares future moves from peoples general, mostly partisan views of the Affordable Care Act to details and consequences of plans to repeal and replace the ACA, one of the biggest flash points is likely to be how people with pre-existing medical conditions are affected.  Across the U.S., people who have cancer, heart disease, diabetes, or other serious conditions will want to know whether they or their sick family members will be able to get and afford coverage in the future. Their partisan views about Obamacare are likely to quickly be supplanted by these more practical concerns. And a substantial number of people could be affected.  A Kaiser Family Foundation analysis to be released next week found that almost 30% of U.S. adults younger than 65 have health conditions that would have left them uninsurable in a pre-ACA world. Many more people have conditions with which they could still qualify for coverage before ACA protections took effectbut only at premiums they could not afford. Many people with conditions over which coverage could be declined before the ACA live in big red states (there are more than 4 million in Texas, for example) and in blue states (nearly 6 million in California). As the chart above shows, however, the 11 states with the largest shares of adults who have pre-existing conditions are all controlled by Republicans, and most are in the South. These states have higher rates of residents with conditions over which coverage was declined before the ACA, such as obesity and diabetes.  Still, even more Americans may feel that they have a stake in policies regarding pre-existing conditions. Kaisers monthly health tracking poll found in August that 53% of Americans said that they or a family member had a pre-existing condition after being read a definition of the term. Most people with pre-existing conditions are insured at any given time through employer plans or public programs such as Medicaid. Before the ACA, however, they would have been unable to get coverage again if they lost their insurance through a change in circumstances. Because so many people with a pre-existing condition have to worry about whether their circumstances might change someday, a much larger share of the public is likely to be interested in this issue than the number of people who stand to be affected immediately by policy changes.  President-elect Donald Trump has said that he wants to protect people who have pre-existing medical conditions. Details of Republican health-care plans are not yet known, but they are expected to involve establishing high-risk pools within states, among other measures. Without the plan details it is hard to say how strong protections will be.  Tens of millions of people with pre-existing medical conditions and the influential groups that represent them will be interested in details of legislative plans to change the ACA and how they might be affected. Its sometimes said that this has become a post-factual world. But as health care moves from a campaign issue to the legislative agenda, people will want to know how changes would affect them, and details and facts will matter more again. "
13,Real,"Trump says nobody really knows if climate change is real President-elect Donald Trump said Sunday that nobody really knows whether climate change is real and that he is studying whether the United States should withdraw from the global warming agreement struck in Paris a year ago.  In an interview with Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace, Trump said hes very open-minded on whether climate change is underway but has serious concerns about how President Obamas efforts to cut carbon emissions have undercut Americas global competitiveness.  Im still open-minded. Nobody really knows, Trump said. Look, Im somebody that gets it, and nobody really knows. Its not something thats so hard and fast. I do know this: Other countries are eating our lunch.  There is a broad scientific consensus that human activity  including the burning of fossil fuels for transportation, heating and industrial manufacturing  is driving recent climate change. In its most recent report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that it is extremely likely that, since the 1950s, humans and their greenhouse gas emissions have been the dominant cause of the planets warming trend. The top 10 hottest years on record have all been since 1998, and 2016 is expected to be the hottest year since formal record-keeping began in 1880.  But its not the first time that Trump has disregarded that established scientific view.  During the presidential campaign, Trump referred to climate change as a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese, a comment he later described as a joke. But during a town hall in New Hampshire, he also mocked the idea of global warming. At that event, Meghan Andrade, a volunteer for the League of Conservation Voters, asked Trump what he would do to address the issue, to which he replied: Let me ask you this  take it easy, fellas  how many people here believe in global warming? Do you believe in global warming?  After asking three times Who believes in global warming? and soliciting a show of hands, Trump concluded that nobody believed climate change was underway except for Andrade.  During Sundays interview with Wallace, Trump said he needed to balance any environmental regulation against the fact that manufacturers and other businesses in China and elsewhere are able to operate without the kind of restrictions faced by their U.S. competitors.  If you look at what  I could name country after country. You look at whats happening in Mexico, where our people are just  plants are being built, and they dont wait 10 years to get an approval to build a plant, okay? he said. They build it like the following day or the following week. We cant let all of these permits that take forever to get stop our jobs.  The U.S. has outpaced the rest of the developed world in terms of growth since the 2008 recession, though developing countries such as China boast higher growth rates. Typically, economists compare the U.S. against other industrialized nations since developing countries typically grow faster than their developed counterparts.  The New York businessman made the same critique of the Environmental Protection Agency, to which he has nominated Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt  a climate change skeptic  as the head. Wallace asked whether he was going to take a wrecking ball to the Obama legacy, to which Trump replied, No. No. No. I dont want to do that at all.  I just want whats right.  EPA, you cant get things approved. I mean, people are waiting in line for 15 years before they get rejected, okay?  he said. Thats why people dont want to invest in this country.  It is unclear which permit application Trump was referring to, but he has repeatedly criticized EPA rules. And though he has given mixed signals on whether he would back out of the United States voluntary commitments under the Paris climate agreement, it would take several years for the next administration to withdraw now that the agreement has entered into force.   Last week Trumps transition team for the Energy Department asked officials there to identify which employees have participated in international climate negotiations or worked on domestic efforts to cut greenhouse gases, such as calculating the social cost of carbon. Several scientists, federal union officials and public watchdog groups have expressed concern that these individuals could be targeted for retaliation once Trump takes office.  Trump transition team for Energy Department seeks names of employees involved in climate meetings  Play Video1:54 The Trump transition team has issued a list of 74 questions for the Energy Department, asking officials there to identify which department employees and contractors have worked on forging an international climate pact as well as domestic efforts to cut the nation's carbon output. (Whitney Shefte/The Washington Post) At the urging of daughter Ivanka, Trump has met in the past week with former vice president Al Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio, both environmental activists.

14,Real,"Brexit Uncertainties Threaten Brain Drain for UK Science Like many foreign scientists in Britain, Joanna Bagniewska was devastated when Britons voted to leave the European Union. The biology lecturer, a Polish migrant who found Britain a welcoming place to build her academic career over a decade, is suddenly seeing her job security and research prospects up in the air.  ""I'm worried that after my current contract finishes, one of the prerequisites could be a permanent residence card,"" she said. ""I'd like to apply for EU grant money, but how much longer will it be available for?""  Britain's top universities have long been among the world's most sought-after destinations for study and research, drawing the brightest minds from all corners of the globe. But since Britons voted in June to leave the 28-nation EU, many in the science community say the U.K. risks losing the money, the international influence  and crucially, the talent  to sustain that enviable position.  More than one-tenth of research funding at British universities has come from the EU in recent years. Some fields  such as nanotechnology and cancer research  are more dependent on EU funding than others, according to a report by technology firm Digital Science. From 2007 to 2013, Britain received 8.8 billion euros ($9.4 billion) in direct EU investment in research.  Bagniewska is not just anxious about herself  she's upset for her students' future too, for the opportunities that both Britons and foreigners will likely miss out on when unfettered mobility between Britain and Europe can no longer be taken for granted.  ""They were just getting excited about doing their masters and Ph.Ds in other countries. And then Brexit happened and they just got trampled,"" she said.  Scientists and researchers argue that being part of the EU has given British science a huge boost because it allows Britain to recruit the best talent across Europe and take part in important research collaborations and student exchanges without being constrained by national boundaries. The bloc's freedom of movement means its 500 million people can live and work visa-free in any member state.  No one knows yet what form Britain's exit from the EU  commonly known as Brexit  is going to take, but immigration was a key issue for ""Leave"" voters. Many believe some limit should be put on the number of EU citizens moving to Britain.  Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed to reassert control over British borders. She has offered no firm guarantees for the rights of Europeans already living in Britain, an uncertainty that weighs heavily over the 32,000 Europeans who make up 16 percent of the academic workforce in British universities. Many universities say the rhetoric over immigration control is also jeopardizing recruitment of researchers and students from further afield.  Scientists for EU, an advocacy group, says it has received over 400 letters from researchers describing how Brexit has already impacted their life and work. Some are losing doctoral students who pulled out of studentships and job offers. Academics are putting plans to relocate to Britain on hold. One said their employer, a London university, immediately imposed a temporary hiring freeze, citing uncertainties about student recruitment and research income.  Adam Durrant, a British entrepreneur who founded an aerospace startup supplying climate data to airlines and aircraft manufacturers, says he's now considering moving some of his business to a EU country outside of Britain. Part of the reason, he says, is that Brexit will likely make hiring the right people much harder than before.  ""In the future, it probably means that people would be less interested to come to the U.K. to work,"" said Durrant. ""There's a huge question mark over my company and my own personal future. I will certainly retain a U.K. presence, but my company's focus of gravity may shift elsewhere.""  Scientists say some U.K.-based researchers are already being excluded from joint bids for EU funding to minimize the risks for their colleagues.  Paul Crowther, head of physics and astronomy at the University of Sheffield, said a researcher from his department was dropped from an EU grant proposal as a precaution following the Brexit referendum. The vote ""put the U.K.-based researchers in a very awkward position"" and their participation in EU-funded programs could ""compromise the project,"" he was told.  ""The erosion of U.K. involvement in EU networks has already begun, with both the U.K. and EU science worse off,"" Crowther said.  Apart from a loss of grant money, Brexit will likely cause British scientists and research centers to miss out on shared databases and infrastructure.  ""Large-scale efforts like studies of rare genetic diseases, the building of large facilities, are areas that multinational collaborations do much better,"" said Venki Ramakrishnan, a Nobel Prize-winning biologist and president of Britain's prestigious Royal Society.  The EU is an important source of research funding for Britain, which lags behind many developed countries in state investment in science. In 2014, Britain's government spent under 0.5 percent of its GDP on research  below the European average, and half that of South Korea.  May's government is clearly aware of the jitters. She has promised to increase annual investment in research by 2 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) by 2020, in hopes her country can remain a world leader in science and innovation.  Durrant is doubtful that's enough to make a big difference.  ""Two billion a year spread across everything isn't going to go very far,"" he said.  Similar anxieties are being felt at the undergraduate level. The 125,000 European students studying at British universities now pay the same fees as locals and have access to the same government loans. Officials have promised this will not change for those applying next year  but no one knows what will happen after that.  Fewer European students appeared to be applying for some of Britain's most competitive university courses, including medicine and places at Oxford and Cambridge. In September, the admission service UCAS reported a 9 percent drop in EU applications for British undergraduate courses starting in 2017.  Some argue that Britain could become like Switzerland, an ""associate"" EU state that is opting out of free movement of people while still taking part in limited European science projects.  ""It's not all doom and gloom  but it will be harder,"" Ramakrishnan said. ""We could make a go of it outside the EU. But for that to happen, we have to attract talent and fund science. And those two things are critical."""
15,Real,"Inside the Clinton Email Search Warrant The search warrant that authorized the FBI to examine a laptop in connection with Hillary Clintons use of a private email server as secretary of state was released today, and the Clinton camp says it shows that Director James Comey's ""intrusion"" into the election was ""utterly unjustified.""  Clinton had been dogged by the issue of her private email server throughout the campaign and Comey dealt a surprise blow when he said that the FBI was looking into the emails found on former New York Rep. Anthony Weiner's computer just days before the election.  According to the warrant and supporting documents, investigators said they found thousands of emails belonging to top Hillary Clinton adviser Huma Abedin on the computer belonging to her estranged husband, Weiner. Both of their names are redacted.  The laptop's hard drive, according to sources, was being examined in unrelated investigations into alleged sexting by Weiner.  Warrant Related to Clinton Emails to Be Unsealed Tuesday Warrant Obtained to Start Reviewing Emails Found on Laptop Used by Clinton Aide FBI Says Review of New Emails Doesn't Change Conclusion Clinton Shouldn't Be Charged When discovered, the FBI believed the emails were ""outside the scope"" of their investigation into Weiner, and did not look at them beyond the subject line and e-mail address information, according to the newly released documents.  According to the affidavit, the FBI had already reviewed more than 30,000 emails and found 2,115 contained classified information, including 22 with Top Secret information.  Analysis of those emails ""revealed more than 4,000 work-related emails between [redacted] and Clinton from 2009 and 2013."" The redaction is believed to refer to Abedin.  According to the affidavit, the FBIs prior investigation found that among the 4,000, some 27 email chains containing classified information ""have been transmitted through [redacted] and/or [redacted] accounts,"" which again are believed to be between Abedin and Clinton.  ""Because it has been determined by relevant original classification authorities that many emails were exchanged between [redacted] and/or [redacted] accounts and Clinton that contained classified information, there is also probable cause to believe that the correspondence between them located on Subject Laptop contains classified information,"" the affidavit says.  The FBI search of the laptop came during the final days of the presidential election, months after Comey announced that the bureau had effectively closed its investigation.  E. Randol Schoenberg, a Los Angeles attorney who petitioned to have the documents unsealed, said in a statement to ABC News he was ""appalled.""  ""I see nothing at all in the search warrant application that would give rise to probable cause, nothing that would make anyone suspect that there was anything on the laptop beyond what the FBI had already searched and determined not to be evidence of a crime, nothing to suggest that there would be anything other than routine correspondence between Secretary Clinton and her longtime aide Huma Abedin,"" he said.  On Oct. 28, Comey disclosed to Congress that the FBI would be looking at the newly discovered emails, but it remains unclear when the emails were discovered and how long it took for that information to be communicated to Comey. The warrant was approved two days later.  Just two days before the election, Comey issued a second letter to Congress, stating, ""based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.""  It's unclear what impact Comey's letters had on the election, but Clinton told top donors that she thought Comey's letter to Congress was a turning point in the contest between her and now President-elect Donald Trump.  Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon tweeted today that ""the unsealed filings regarding Huma's emails reveals Comey's intrusion on the election was as utterly unjustified as we suspected at time.""  Stephen Saltzburg, George Washington University Law Professor, said that Comey didn't need to ""run the risk"" of making Clinton look even worse right before the election -- a move that broke with FBI protocol about commenting on ongoing investigations.  ""They [FBI] had to assure themselves that there was no classified information at risk on a computer that they didnt have. They had no obligation, however, to go public about what they were doing,"" he said.  Officials at both the FBI and the Department of Justice declined to comment to ABC News."
16,Real,"Trump has no idea how to run a superpower, say Chinese media Donald Trump appears to have not a clue how to lead a superpower.  That was the conclusion of Chinas Global Times newspaper on Monday morning as the countrys media weighed in on the president-elects latest social media assaults on Beijing.   Don't let China ties slide into 'full conflict mode', Obama urges Trump Read more Trump is not behaving as a president who will become master of the White House in a month, the Communist party controlled newspaper wrote in an editorial. He bears no sense of how to lead a superpower.  The article came after the US president-elect again used Twitter, which has been blocked in China since 2009, to berate the leaders of the worlds second largest economy.  China steals United States Navy research drone in international waters  rips it out of water and takes it to China in unpresidented [sic] act, Trump tweeted early on Saturday morning after it emerged the Chinese navy had seized a US naval drone that had been operating in the South China Sea.  In a second tweet, Trump wrote:  Those 221 characters threatened to further alienate Chinas rulers, already reeling from Trumps recent decision to hold a 10-minute phone call with the Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen, and threat to upend long-standing US policy on Taiwan.  On Friday, President Obama cautioned Trump against allowing relations with China slip into full conflict mode.  In its editorial, the fervently nationalist Global Times, a state-run tabloid that sometimes reflects official thinking, indicated such a deterioration was certainly on the cards if Trump continued to act up.  People in China were unsure whether the billionaires attacks on Beijing were part of attempts to wage a psychological war or simply an example of his amateurishness.  But if he treats China after assuming office in the same way as in his tweets, China will not exercise restraint, the newspaper warned. The Chinese government should be fully prepared for a hardline Trump.  In an online video that has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times, the newspapers controversial editor, Hu Xijin, said: I dont know if he is playing the psychological card with China or is in fact just unprofessional  China should teach him some lessons so he might learn to respect China after he is sworn in.  A comment piece on the front page of the overseas edition of the Communist partys official mouthpiece, the Peoples Daily, also suggested Beijing would not be cowed by Trumps provocations.  It is difficult to understand his true psychology, wrote Hua Yiwen, whom the paper described as an international affairs expert. But China shouldnt spend much effort trying to guess what he is thinking. We should simply stand firm, take control of the situation and handle it calmly.  Bill Bishop, a Washington DC-based China expert, said he sensed abject despair in the US capital at how Trump was conducting US-China relations through misspelled tweets.  This is unpresidented behaviour by a precedent-elect, joked Bishop. It would be funny if the stakes werent so high.   China should plan to take Taiwan by force after Trump call, state media says Read more This is not a business deal. This is a political relationship between nuclear powers who are already on the path towards conflict in several dimensions, added Bishop, who publishes the influential Sinocism newsletter.  This kind of uncertainty, this kind of petulance, this kind of random tweeting  is not a grand strategy that is going to push the Chinese on to their heels so they are going to make concessions. This is juvenile, immature, inexperienced behaviour that has the potential to lead to many problems in the US-China relationship, some of which could have some pretty serious and damaging ramifications.  Bishop questioned the Chinese medias suggestion that Trumps tweets were part of a wily psychological ploy to force trade concessions from Beijing. I wouldnt ascribe brilliant psychological warfare skills to Donald Trump, he said.  Was it possible Trumps tweets were part of an ingenious new master plan for Sino-US relations that would emerge after his inauguration on 20 January? Bishop was skeptical.  I think that is about as likely as Xi Jinping waking up on 1 December, 2017 and declaring China a democracy."
17,Real,"North Carolina legislators to reconsider transgender bathroom bill RALEIGH, N.C.  Legislators who passed the North Carolina law known as the bathroom bill nine months ago head back to the capital on Wednesday to consider repealing it. But theres uncertainty over exactly what lawmakers will do, in part because this Republican-controlled legislature has shown a willingness to go its own way, despite intense outside pressure to scrap the law.  Legislators returned to Raleigh for a special session called by GOP Gov. Pat McCrory to eliminate House Bill 2 -- the bathroom bill -- which has been blasted by gay-rights groups and resulted in job losses and sporting event cancellations.  No repeal bill backed by Republicans had been made public by midday. Instead, House Republicans returned to a closed-door meeting Wednesday morning that continued into the afternoon. They held a similar meeting that lasted for more than four hours Tuesday night. Some Republicans were unhappy after learning that Charlotte on Monday had not repealed its entire nondiscrimination ordinance, which had been the genesis of HB2, Republican repeal supporter Rep. Chuck McGrady said.  On a difficult issue where the parties dont have a lot of trust, we got thrown a curveball by the less than full repeal by Charlotte, McGrady tweeted early Wednesday.  The fact that McCrory called lawmakers back to Raleigh a month before their 2017 sessions start was challenged by an opponent of HB2s repeal.  There is no extraordinary circumstance, said Rep. Jeff Collins, R-Nash, during a brief debate over session procedures, other than the extraordinary hubris of a city council telling us we have to act by a certain date. Mondays action by the Charlotte council was contingent on HB2s repeal by Dec. 31.  Over the past year, there has been bitter fighting between Democrats and Republicans. Just last week, Republican leaders convened a surprise legislative session and passed two laws designed to bring Democratic Gov.-elect Roy Coopers powers in check when he becomes governor Jan. 1.  Cooper blasted McCrory over House Bill 2 during the governors race, and the fallout over the law  job losses, canceled concerts and sporting events  contributed to McCrorys narrow defeat. The wide-ranging law is best known for requiring transgender people to use restrooms corresponding to the sex on their birth certificate in many public buildings.  GOP Rep. Chuck McGrady of Hendersonville supports repealing the entire law and said he believes a significant number of House members from both parties do as well.  Everybody is acting in good faith in my opinion, McGrady said. House Republicans met by phone Monday and would meet in person in Raleigh later Tuesday, he said.  However, lawmakers were already under pressure from some conservative groups to keep HB2 in place.  Were sending the message to our supporters that lawmakers should not now betray people who supported them and compromise common-sense principles like privacy, dignity and freedom from our citizens, said Tami Fitzgerald, executive director of the North Carolina Values Coalition.  House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger have only issued a brief statement Monday, saying they would take up the repeal of HB2. They also criticized Cooper for taking too much credit.  They did not return messages for comment Tuesday.  Charlotte appears to have held up its end of the bargain, but the measure enacted Monday notes that its dependent on HB2 being repealed in its entirety by Dec. 31. That could give some lawmakers justification not to repeal it.  Cooper, who helped broker Charlottes cooperation with phone calls over the weekend, expects a full repeal, his spokeswoman Megan Jacobs said late Monday.  The law also limits statewide protections for LGBT people in public accommodation and employment, and it reinforced a prohibition on local governments from raising minimum wage. Local governments are also prevented from enacting nondiscrimination measures that would go further than state law.  The session is scheduled several days before Christmas, with some legislators out of town.  GOP Rep. Jeff Collins of Rocky Mount, who voted for HB2 in March, told The Wilson Times that he was not interested in repealing anything. I think we did the right thing the first time, he told the newspaper.  Passing a repeal would only require a handful of GOP support  perhaps 10 in the Senate or 15 in the House  if all Democrats voted for it.  Discussions about repealing the law increased after decisions by the NCAA and Atlantic Coast Conference to move their championship events out of North Carolina this academic year. The NBA also moved an All-Star Game out of Charlotte.  Democratic Rep. Grier Martin of Raleigh said until theres a full repeal, Im pretty certain that were not going to see another NBA All-Star Game or NCAA tournament game in North Carolina.  LGBT advocates said they were cautiously hopeful.  We are holding out hope that the legislators will keep their word, said Simone Bell, Southern Regional Director for the LGBT-rights group Lambda Legal. We want complete and full repeal of HB 2."
18,Real,"In Reversal, Gambian President Rejects Loss And Calls For New Election After publicly conceding electoral defeat last week, President Yahya Jammeh of Gambia has reversed course and is calling for a new election.  Jammeh has ruled the tiny West African country since seizing power in a coup in 1994, and his public concession to President-elect Adama Barrow on Dec. 2 led to hopes of the first peaceful transition of power in Gambia since it became independent from the U.K. in 1965.  On Friday, Jammeh said the Independent Electoral Commission made errors in vote tallies.  ""In the same way that I accepted faithfully the results, believing that the IEC was independent and honest and reliable, I hereby reject the results in totality,"" Jammeh said in a televised speech.  He also said there were other irregularities and problems in the electoral process.  ""Our investigations reveal that in some cases, voters were told that the opposition has already won and there was no need for them to vote,"" Jammeh said.  Last week, supporters of the opposition took to the streets to celebrate Barrow's win. Jammeh's allegations are now ""plunging Gambia into confusion and uncertainty,"" NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton reports.  President-elect Barrow responded, telling reporters, ""The outgoing president has no constitutional authority to reject the result of the election and order for fresh elections to be held,"" Reuters reports. ""I urge him to change his current position and accept the verdict of the people in good faith for the sake of the Gambia, our homeland, whose people deserve peace and freedom and prosperity,"" he added to The Associated Press.  The U.S. joined international bodies in condemning the announcement.  ""This action is a reprehensible and unacceptable breach of faith with the people of The Gambia and an egregious attempt to undermine a credible election process and remain in power illegitimately,"" State Department spokesman Mark C. Toner said in a press release.  The Economic Community of West African States, the U.N. and African Union echoed the sentiment in a joint statement:  ""They call on the government of The Gambia to abide by its constitutional responsibilities and international obligations. It is fundamental that the verdict of the ballots should be respected, and that the security of the president -elect Adama Barrow, and that of all Gambian citizen be fully ensured.""  Wire services report the streets of the capital Banjul were calm Saturday, with a heavy presence of police and soldiers. Gambians closed down shops and stayed home out of fear of violence.  Human rights groups have criticized Jammeh for abuses during his 22-year rule. In its 2016 report, Human Rights Watch said his government ""frequently committed serious human rights violations including arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, and torture against those who voiced opposition to the government,"" creating ""a climate of fear within Gambia.""  On Saturday, the organization retweeted a statement from deputy program director Babatunde Olugboji saying they were ""deeply concerned.""  Diplomats told Reuters that it's unclear what international organizations plan to do, but there is a precedent for military intervention. In 1981, they note, the surrounding country of Senegal sent in troops to stop a coup in Gambia.  Opposition leader Mai Ahmad Fatty urged calm. ""We are working round the clock to restore sanity,"" he told the AP. ""We have the full support of our people. The world is with us."""
19,Real,"Donald Trump: It's Bill Clinton Who 'Doesn't Know Much' A war of words between Donald Trump and Bill Clinton escalated after the former president told a local newspaper that Trump ""doesn't know much"" and blamed his wife's loss in the race for the White House on FBI Director James Comey and Russian hackers.  The president-elect took to his Twitter feed to respond Tuesday morning.  Clinton made the initial remarks last week to a group of people he ran into at a small bookstore in Westchester County, NY, including an editor at the Bedford-Pound Ridge Record Review, who published Clinton's comments.  Play Trump under pressure to acknowledge Russian hacking Facebook Twitter Google Plus Embed Trump under pressure to acknowledge Russian hacking 7:23 ""James Comey cost her the election,"" Clinton reportedly said, referring to Comey sending a letter to lawmakers just two weeks before the election about the finding of new emails the FBI said could be pertinent to an investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server during her time as secretary of state. Clinton added, ""We were seven (percentage) points up"" in the polls and slated to win before Comey's announcement.  Two days before the election, Comey told members of Congress that the FBI found nothing new in the e-mails but Clinton maintained the damage had already been done.  In the reports of Clinton's stop at the bookstore, Clinton was characterized has having had taken a call from Trump after the election and described it as ""cordial."" On Tuesday afternoon, Clinton sought to clear up who initiated the phone call through his own Twitter feed:  Clinton was also asked at the book store if he thought Trump was a smart man. ""He doesn't know much. One thing he does know is how to get angry, white men to vote for him,"" Clinton reportedly responded. He had previously said he believed Russia was also to blame for releasing internal Democratic emails and documents that hurt his wife's election's prospects before Election Day.  ""I've watched her battle through that bogus email deal and be vindicated at the end,"" Clinton said earlier this week. ""She fought through everything, and she prevailed against it all. But, you know, with the end we had the Russians and the FBI deal, which she couldn't prevail against that."""
20,Real,"After Diplomat's Killing, Russia Doubles Down On Ties With Turkey Tuesday was supposed to be a day of triumph for Russian diplomacy, when Russia aimed to replace the United States as the indispensable power in the Middle East. Instead, it became a day of mourning, with a Turkish honor guard in Ankara loading the flag-draped coffin of Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov onto a Moscow-bound plane.  Karlov, who was assassinated in an Ankara art gallery Monday evening, had been given the delicate mission of patching up relations after Turkey shot down a Russian warplane last year. On Tuesday, Karlov's efforts were to be crowned by a meeting in Moscow of the foreign and defense ministers of Russia, Turkey and Iran  and the rise of a new power constellation in the Middle East.  Those talks went ahead despite his death. Afterward, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov declared the three-country format ""the most effective"" in resolving the Syrian conflict, since his talks with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had run aground. Last week, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, accused Russia and Iran of bearing responsibility for ""atrocities"" committed during the Syrian government's assault on the city of Aleppo.  With a lame-duck administration in the White House for the next month, Russia is using territorial gains in Syria to seize the diplomatic initiative as well. Because the Syrian government's retaking of Aleppo has happened so fast, Lavrov agreed to move up the Moscow meeting with his Turkish and Iranian colleagues by a week.  That's why the reaction to Karlov's murder  by an off-duty Turkish policeman who shouted about avenging the carnage in Aleppo before being shot to death himself  was practically unanimous in Moscow. The official line from Russian President Vladimir Putin on down was that the assassination in Ankara was a ""provocation"" meant to derail the talks.   Members of a Turkish honor guard carry the coffin of Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov at the airport in Ankara.  When Turkey shot down a Russian Su-24 warplane along the Turkey-Syria border in November 2015, Putin's response was fast and furious. Diplomatic and economic relations were put on hold until last summer, when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan finally issued an apology.  On Monday, the blame in Moscow for the ambassador's killing was assigned to unnamed forces that are opposed to Russia and Turkey's rapprochement. Putin talked on the phone with Erdogan, who agreed to let in a team of Russian investigators.  Putin needs Erdogan, and Erdogan needs Putin. The two leaders are facing isolation from traditional partners because of their policies against domestic opponents and militant nostalgia for bygone empires. What to do about Syria  once a bone of contention between Russia and Turkey  has become an opportunity for both countries to act as power brokers in a global crisis.  The importance of that relationship is clear from the number of contacts the two countries have had since Erdogan's conciliatory visit to Russia back in August. In the space of the past month, Putin has been on the phone with Erdogan half a dozen times, and the Turkish leader is expected to travel to Russia again in January.  Just a little more than a year ago, Putin was accusing Erdogan of ""a stab in the back"" and estimated ISIS oil sales via Turkey in the hundreds of millions  if not billions  of dollars.  Now, responsibility for Karlov's assassination is being attributed to powers farther afield.  ""Murder of our ambassador is continuation of information war against Russia. Media hysteria created conditions for it. Info attacks lead to terrorist attacks,"" Russian senator Alexei Pushkov tweeted on Tuesday.  Russian nationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who happens to hold a degree in Turkish studies, didn't shy away from blaming the West directly.  ""Turkey is turning away from the West. That's disadvantageous for certain Western intelligence agencies,"" Zhirinovsky said on state television Monday night.  The European Union and NATO are afraid that Russia will join forces with Iran and Turkey, he said, presenting the West with a formidable counterweight. So far, Karlov's efforts to that end have not been in vain."
21,Real,"Rand Paul Gives Glimpse of Trouble Trump May Face With His Party Over Government Spending Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul gave an indication today of the trouble that President-elect Trump may face from his own party in trying to fulfill campaign promises that cost money.  The former GOP presidential candidate said on ABC News' ""This Week"" that he ""won't vote for a budget that never balances"" and that he is working to find a few other conservative GOP senators to join him.  ""The current budget that the Republicans are looking at never balances. How can that be fiscally responsible? And how can we look at the public with a straight face and say, yes, we ran on balanced budgets, we're for the balanced budget amendment, and yet the budget we're going to introduce, that we're going to repeal Obamacare with never balances?"" Paul said.  Trump this week repeated his promise that he wants a trillion-dollar infrastructure program and he promised during the campaign to repeal Obamacare.  Paul said that with the help of other conservative senators he might be able to block a budget that he considers irresponsible.  ""All it takes is a couple of us. If there are a few conservatives in the Senate wing of the Republican Party that will say no to a budget that never balances, we could have the power to say to the leadership, you know what, we need a better budget,"" Paul said.  ""I don't know if it will happen, but I know that I will be one that won't vote for a budget that never balances,"" he said.  Paul also addressed reports that ExxonMobile CEO Rex Tillerson has emerged as a likely pick for secretary of state, saying that he is ""going to reserve judgment on Tillerson.""  But the Kentucky senator had strong warnings about former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, who is a possible contender for secretary of state or deputy secretary of state.  ""I'll do anything to try to prevent John Bolton from getting any position because I think his world view is naive,"" Paul said. ""He still believes in regime change. He's still a big cheerleader for the Iraq War. He's promoted a nuclear attack by Israel on Iran. He wants to do regime change in Iran.""  ""John Bolton doesn't get it,"" Paul said."
22,Real,"New push to replace Obamacare reignites old GOP tensions Republicans on Capitol Hill are already laying the groundwork for a rapid repeal of President Obamas signature health-care law beginning on the first day of the new Congress, before President-elect Donald Trump is even sworn in.  But the urgent efforts to make good on a Republican campaign promise six years in the making obscure major GOP divisions over what exactly to replace Obamacare with and how to go about it, and how long a transition period to allow before the laws insurance would go away.  Hard-liners are pushing to move as fast as possible, bolstered by a GOP base eager to see lawmakers follow through on years of promises. But key congressional leaders are keenly concerned about potentially throwing millions off their insurance plans and repeating what they have long decried as Democratic missteps eight years ago, sparking a fierce political backlash by moving too far, too fast.  While Trump could sign legislation gutting the Affordable Care Act before the spring bloom, a full replacement could take months, if not years.  Id like to do it tomorrow, but reality is another matter sometimes, said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee that will help lead the repeal and replace efforts. We have to live with the real world. And the real world right now is that the Democrats wont help with anything. S Donald Trump has campaigned to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare, once he gets into office. Now that he's won the presidency with a majority Republican House and Senate, that feat might not prove to be too easy. Wonkblog's Max Ehrenfreund explains. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) Hatch and other high-ranking Republican senators are pushing for an extended transition period that could keep large portions of Obamacare in effect until 2019 or beyond, allowing time to carefully craft a replacement and push the final debate past the midterm elections.  Many of them, like Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), have been chastened by conversations with insurers and state regulators who are warning of chaos in the market for individual insurance if Congress moves rashly.  I dont want to leave the 84,000 people in Maine who are buying insurance on the exchange uninsured because, all of a sudden, two-thirds of them who have subsidies have lost that subsidy, Collins said.  But those Republicans are clashing with GOP colleagues  many of them sent to Congress in the midterm, anti-Obama waves of 2010 and 2014  who see little reason to dawdle.  The history of this place is, the longer it takes, the more exponentially the probability grows that itll never get done, said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), elected recently as the new chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus. Republicans have been saying they have a replacement plan for over two years, so why do we need three years?  Part of the problem is that Republicans have never been able to agree on a replacement plan, despite railing against Obamacare for nearly eight years now. Their foot-dragging is a function of internal divisions and the political peril of floating a detailed alternative that would be closely evaluated for costs and benefits. Trump has also been vague, promising a terrific replacement that will provide great health care at a fraction of the cost.  The current battle centers on when exactly to schedule Obamacares sunset. But other fights loom  over what precisely a replacement plan should look like, whether Obamacares Medicaid expansion will continue, whether lawmakers should also now tackle the future of Medicare, and how Congress should assist insurers during the transition.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has announced plans to put an Obamacare repeal on the Senate floor on Jan. 3. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) The battle lines, however, are familiar, with establishment Republicans on one side and conservative insurgents, mainly in the House, on the other. Those dynamics pushed GOP leaders into increasingly dramatic confrontations with President Obama and last year helped force House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) to retire.  Come Jan. 20, Obama will no longer serve as a foil for Republicans, and while Senate Democrats could block parts of a health-care overhaul, the real fight will occur inside the GOP.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has announced plans to put an Obamacare repeal on the Senate floor come Jan. 3. But that will only set the stage for a future repeal bill that will have to tackle major decisions such as a sunset date and interim measures to stabilize insurance markets.  So far, Trump and key GOP leaders on Capitol Hill have shied away from taking firm positions on repeal and replace, but they have done little to tamp down the expectations of conservatives expecting a swift and wholesale substitute.  Were going to repeal Obamacare lock, stock and barrel, Vice President-elect Mike Pence told donors to the conservative Heritage Foundation recently. The number one priority of this administration is to keep that promise to the American people.  Hard-liners on Capitol Hill see Pence and Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), Trumps pick for health and human services secretary, as allies in their push for quick and decisive action. Pence called on Congress to pass a repeal bill with all deliberate speed but pledged only to then set into motion a process to replace it.  House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said Thursday that Republicans would move as well and as fast as we can but make sure that the transition does not pull the rug out from under people.  Transition spokesman Sean Spicer said Friday that Obamacare replacement strategy has been part of discussions Trump and Pence are having with top congressional leaders and that the talks are ongoing.  The idea is to really figure out the sequencing on both the repeal and the replace, he said.  Conservative activists who pushed a take-no-prisoners approach toward the Obama administration say their patience is limited.  When Republicans have the House, the Senate and the White House, you dont wait, said Adam Brandon, president and chief executive of FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group. Im a Cleveland Indians fan. I only get a shot at a World Series every couple decades. When you have a shot to do it, you do it. Thats it.  Democrats and many health-care experts are warning that a swift repeal could lead insurers to stop selling policies to individuals on federally mandated exchanges. More than 12 million Americans are covered under those policies.  Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell briefed Senate Democrats on Thursday on the expected unraveling of Obamacares insurance exchanges, according to people familiar with her remarks inside the closed-door meeting.  Delayed replacement is a situation where it is basically repeal and chaos in terms of what will ensue, because of the uncertainty that will get presented to insurers, providers, consumers and states, Burwell told reporters after the meeting.  Republicans want to end Obamacares system of penalties and subsidies. But many  including Trump  want to continue to ban insurers from denying coverage or sharply increasing rates for the sick.  Experts warn that repeal and delay under those conditions would prompt insurers to flee the individual market. Linda J. Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said insurers could face as much as $3 billion in losses if healthy individuals leave the market once the subsidies and penalties are eliminated.  That $3 billion is the tip of the iceberg, Blumberg said. With all of these changes and the uncertainty, it is hard to predict how bad the risk is going to get.  Keeping insurers in the market during the transition could require Congress to step in with bailout payments, something that would be deeply unpopular among conservative lawmakers.  The insurance industry should understand that theres a new sheriff in town, said Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.), a Freedom Caucus member. They signed up for Obamacare, and if they want to make a profit, theyre going to have to figure out how to make a profit in a free-market insurance industry.  The strategy of repealing Obamacare without first replacing it reflects not only the wishes of the GOP base, but also Senate arithmetic.  There will be a slim 52-to-48 Republican majority come January, and while Republicans can gut Obamacare with a simple majority using arcane budget rules, passing a complete replacement will require 60 votes.  Only by dismantling Obamacare first, Republicans say, will they have a chance to persuade enough Democrats to support a replacement plan  and Democrats have already signaled that they will not do so.  We all know we have to repeal it to get them to even settle down and work with us at all, Hatch said.  Incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), however, has rejected that strategy. Were not going to do a replacement. If they repeal without a replacement, they will own it, he told The Washington Post recently.  But the Republican base, prodded by conservative media outlets and well-organized activist groups, has been loath to accept Democratic obstruction as an excuse for inaction.  One prominent activist, Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, suggested that Trump could goose the repeal-and-replace efforts by reversing an administrative ruling that gave financial assistance to 11,000 congressional members and staff who were forced onto the Obamacare exchanges under a compromise included in the original law.  I dont think anyone thinks that youre going to flip a switch .?.?. but the replacement for it needs to happen quickly, she said. We want it done as quickly as it possibly can be done.  Brandon was even blunter: This is going to be a hard thing for Republicans, but tough [cookies], he said. Theyre going to have to push this through using parliamentary maneuvers, and guess what? Its hard.  The political risk in doing nothing is why you got Donald Trump in the first place, he added. The old excuses of having divided government, theyre gone.  A few strident Obamacare critics are urging activists to soften a bit. They have to look at the complexity of the problem here, and hopefully theyll recognize that its not quite so simple, said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who was first elected in the 2010 tea party wave.  But many others are not.  Literally every Republican member has made this part of their platform in running for Congress, said Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), a first-termer who will chair the conservative Republican Study Committee next year. Weve got to act on it."

24,Fake,"Recent Study Shows Nearly Six in Ten Trump Supporters are Illiterate CULLMAN, Al.  An independent study conducted by the bipartisan policy group Alliance for Community Organizations seeking Reform Now has determined that just over fifty-nine percent of voters who support Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump suffer from moderate to severe illiteracy.  Posing as representatives from the Nationalist Reform Council  a fictional conservative action group  ACORN officials staged several mock elections last month at community centers throughout Cullman County, Alabama, under the pretense of helping residents register to vote in time for the general election. We were really pleased with the turnout, said Matthew Breyer, who heads ACORNs northern Alabama office. We were able to register nearly twenty thousand voters over the span of three days.  Once residents were successfully registered to vote, ACORN officials ushered them into a room where about a dozen voting booths had been set up. We wanted to get an idea of the average voters understanding of the election process, Breyer said before adding that voters were asked to enter a booth and cast their vote for the candidate of their choice. However, unbeknownst to participants, the ballots had been slightly altered. Under the category U.S. President/U.S. Vice President, you had the option for Clinton/Kaine centered inside a solid red rectangle, Breyer explained. Likewise, the option for Trump/Pence was centered inside a solid blue rectangle.  Following the simulations conclusion, ACORN officials were amazed to discover that more than two-thirds of registered Republicans in Cullman County who participated in the mock election had cast their votes in favor of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. She won by a massive landslide, recalled Breyer. The data we collected seems to suggest that a sizable number of Republican voters are unable to read above a third grade level and are simply casting votes by selecting the color that corresponds with their preferred party.  This should be a major wake up call and I think we need to take a hard look at the educational system in this country, said Fox News contributor and Republican strategist Barry King. This may have been a simulation but weve got multiple GOP leaders saying theres going to be a rigged election next month. Theres a legitimate fear that youll have altered ballots just like this popping up all over the country and as a result, well be forced to suffer another four years under Obamas failed policies.  In recent days, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has increasingly warned supporters that the upcoming presidential election will be rigged against him. Of course there is a large-scale voter fraud happening on and before election day, the former reality TV star tweeted on Monday. Trump has called on his supporters to closely monitor voting centers and has said that he will not willingly accept defeat in the event Clinton secures the presidency.S"

When the House votes 383-0 against Obama, you know there is something majorly wrong with the mentality of the White House.  From Fox News:  The House approved a resolution Monday that declares the Islamic State is committing genocide against Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East  putting even more pressure on the Obama administration to do the same ahead of a deadline later this week.  The resolution passed the House with a unanimous vote of 383-0.  The resolution came to a vote just days after the release of a graphic new report by the Knights of Columbus and In Defense of Christians on ISIS atrocities. The report made the case that the terror campaign against Christians and other minorities in Syria, Iraq and other parts of the Middle East is, in fact, genocide.  When ISIS systematically targets Christians, Yezidis, and other ethnic and religious minorities for extermination, this is not only a grave injusticeit is a threat to civilization itself, Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, R-Neb., said in a statement. We must call the violence by its proper name: genocide.  The resolution was voted on ahead of a congressionally mandated March 17 deadline for Secretary of State John Kerry and the White House to make a decision on whether to make such a declaration. The measure is an effort to force the administrations hand on the issue, as the administration has so far declined to take an official position.  There is a similar measure in the Senate that has yet to be voted on.  Obama may want to protect Islam and disregard Christians, but it is abundantly clear there are hundreds of leaders in the House and Senate who do not agree with Obamas notions.  If the resolution passes the Senate at a similar margin as the house, it will solidify the level of embarrassment our country feels toward Obama."
28,Fake,"Undeniable Foul Play: U.S. Funded Facilities In Afghanistan Now Missing As Obama Leaves Office U.S. Agency for International Developments (USAID) worked in Afghanistan from July 2008 through June 2015 under the Obama administration. The work there included supporting 30 Afghan health facilities. They spend nearly $260 million through the Partnership Contracts for Health Program.  The logic seems sounds, in a country at war; we can help by providing health care. Unfortunately, it seems that USAID is not accomplishing their tasks.  On the website, the USAID claims that during the current administration, The Agency began rebuilding with an eye to getting the most bang out of its funding allocations. This must be code for, We will take millions to build hospitals and lose them, because this is exactly what the group has done.  Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) John Sopko wrote to the agency, stating, One Afghanistan hospital funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development was located more than 430 miles away from the listed coordinates, while another 11 facilities were more than six miles away.  The letter elaborated, SIGAR sought to conduct site inspections at 30 of 79 facilities in Badakhshan  an Afghan province  but was unable to locate one facility. SIGAR found substantial inaccuracies in the geospatial coordinates USAID previously provided for many of these 29 health facilities and observed that not all facilities had access to electricity and drinking water.   The money to help is going somewhere else  Sopko went on to say that only 12 of the inspected facilities were located near the coordinates USAID provided. This means that only about 15% of the hospitals were in the places they were supposed to be.  In some cases, the coordinates given were not even in the correct country, coordinates for 22 of the 79 facilities were not located in the districts listed in the most recent information available to USAID. Coordinates for two health facilities were located in Pakistan; Afghanistans neighboring country to the southeast.  One health facility was actually listed as being in the Mediterranean Sea by USAID. Others were miles from the reported coordinates, four were more than six miles away from their listed coordinates, and another three were between three and six miles away. Another six facilities were between just over a half mile and three miles away, while nine were actually located within about a half mile of their listed location.  It seems as though this has been an ongoing problem for USAID. As SIGAR has stressed previously, robust program oversight requires specific knowledge of the location where the service is provided, Sopko wrote to USAID Administrator Gayle Smith.  A USAID official reported that it would not bother correcting the problem, The agency no longer maintains location data and obtaining it would require a specialized request to the Afghan government, which USAID was unwilling to make.  Sopko countered this statement, USAIDs position regarding its monitoring responsibilities is troubling. [W]e encourage USAID to request and maintain this information, in order to help ensure that funding spent to improve the health of specific populations is actually reaching the intended communities.  It would seem necessary for someone to step in and stop the funding to this program until it starts reporting correctly. Sopko emphasized the importance of this when he stated, Maintaining accurate GPS data would help the USAID conduct site visits and help ensure that the intended communities receive needed health services.  Instead of taking a closer look at what is really happening, the agency will go on funding health centers, providing another $228 million for the facilities. In turn, the United States will keep funding USAID. The bizarre circle of corruption will continue.  USAID has clearly stated their intentions going forward, USAID does not intend to maintain coordinates. They will instead rely on the World Bank and the Afghan government who are now handling the facilities.  Given this set of facts, the U.S. needs to withdraw its funding of the agency. Obama and liberals shown no signs that this will happen though.  The facilities that SIGAR Sopko was able to inspect were in poor condition. [W]e did observe some basic structural concerns at most of the facilities, such as cracked walls, leaking roofs, broken doors, and shattered windows, which indicate clear concerns with sanitation and safety.  Inspectors also found exposed wiring. Electrical deficiencies, such as exposed live wires, pose serious hazards that could endanger the safety of patients and staff.   Horrible conditions  This brings a chilling image of what kind of care the patients might be receiving. Liberals are not concerned that millions are disappearing into a bottomless pit.  Millions have gone to fund clinics that are either misplaced or in such disrepair that they should be closed. Millions more will be given before this funding runs out.  Why is nobody in Washington asking questions?  The answers will leave the White House with Obama. His dirty hands are all over this one as he stands in front of the American public and claims he is concerned, that the government is helping innocent citizens in the war torn country of Afghanistan.  As usual, this is all lies. A more likely scenario, given what we know now, is that he needed a reason to funnel money into the country and the facade of health clinics was believable at the time.  No more money should be sent to any program that Obama has started overseas. His close ties to terrorists should raise red flags for every American.  President Trump needs to undo all of these  projects so that we no longer operate maliciously, negligently, or in a corrupt manner."
29,Fake,"BREAKING: 27 Classified Docs FOUND On Anthony Weiners Laptop Hillarys In TROUBLE The Clinton Machine is coming to screeching halt as 27 email chains containing classified information were found on Anthony Weiners laptop.  Expect the Congressional Republicans to grill Hillary Clinton, her aides, and the FBI for more information on the contents of the emails.  Fox News reports:  A federal court on Tuesday released the search warrant documents filed by the FBI to access a laptop used by disgraced ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner and his estranged wife, Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, revealing new details about why the bureau revisited the email case just days before the presidential election.  The FBIs investigation found 27 email chains containing classified information on a laptop that was never authorized for the storage or transmission of classified or national defense information, according to the application for the warrant, which was partially redacted.  The October re-opening of the Clinton investigation sprung from an unrelated case involving Weiner allegedly sexting with an underage girl. During the course of that inquiry, agents discovered the joint laptop and later found emails addressed to and sent from Clinton.  Its the end of the line for the Clinton crime machine."
30,Fake,"New Study Shows Illegal Immigrants to Outnumber Americans 2 to 1 by 2025 CAMBRIDGE, Ma.  A groundbreaking study conducted by researchers at MIT suggests Americans living in the United States could find themselves outnumbered by illegal immigrants by a staggering ratio of at least two to one within the next ten years unless significant changes are made to U.S. immigration policy.  If we continue traveling at our current trajectory, we as Americans will soon become a minority in our own country, warned Dr. Emilio Martinez. Using satellite imagery obtained from the National Reconnaissance Office, Dr. Martinez and his team were able to map the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States over a ten-year period. What weve seen is an incremental increase of twenty-three per cent over the last decade in the flow of undocumented individuals crossing over our southern border.  The U.S. Census Bureau projects the U.S. population will reach just over 345 million people by 2025. However, according to Dr. Martinez, the current data doesnt factor in the millions of undocumented persons arriving in the United States each year. Our models show that if this trend continues, the population of the United States by 2025 will reach approximately 621 million with just under forty-nine per cent consisting of American citizens, Martinez explained, adding that the data is offset by a 2% margin of error.  In contrast, the population of Mexico, which currently rests at about 126.3 million, is expected to shrink drastically over the next ten years due, in part, to rapidly changing climates and the countrys ongoing internal conflict with violent drug traffickers. Mexicans -as weve seen over the last quarter century  have already begun to emigrate north into the U.S. and Canada, said Luis Garcia, a third-year statistics major at MIT who serves as an assistant to Dr. Martinez. These numbers, while relatively small, are expected to rise exponentially over the next four decades.  Garcias data shows that by 2050, a number of Central and South American countries including Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, could see their populations dwindle below 2.5 million. These people arent simply disappearing, said Garcia. On the contrary, theyre coming to the United States."
31,Fake,"Special Report: Obamas Bathroom Breaks Cost Taxpayers $4.1 Billion in 2015 WASHINGTON, D.C.  According to a new report scheduled for public release this week by the Government Accountability Office, President Obamas bathroom breaks may have cost U.S. taxpayers just over $4 billion in 2015. Data provided to the GAO by the Obama administration shows that on average, President Barack Obama took 3.5 bathroom breaks a day last year, with each trip to the toilet lasting four minutes or less.  By the GAOs estimate, the commander-in-chief spent just over eighty-five hours in the bathroom in 2015 alone. The question on everyones mind when they look at a report like this is, What exactly is he doing in there?' Wondered Republican senator John McCain. The former POW admitted to C-SPAN that he goes to the bathroom about once a day on a good day.  Even so, the Arizona senator cited a particularly disturbing quote from the report stating that on October 23rd, the day former secretary of state Hillary Clinton was scheduled to testify before the House Select Committee on Benghazi, President Obama took a record-breaking twenty-one minute bathroom break. I think its very telling, Senator McCain said.  The average adult male uses the restroom anywhere from three times a day to once every three days, said Dr. Deepak Gupta, a senior scatologist at Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore. Ideally we see about one ounce of stool per every twelve pounds of body weight, Dr. Gupta explained, continuing, With that said, President Obama -who weighs about one hundred eighty pounds, should produce about fifteen ounces of solid fecal matter per bowel movement.  However, Dr. Gupta pointed out that due to unusually high levels of stress associated with the job of running the country, President Obama likely produces well below average stools. In all probability, the guy is a stool softener addict, Dr. Gupta told Real News Right Now.  Despite President Obamas low performance rating in the bathroom, the GAO estimates he still uses an above-average amount of toilet paper and -if hes a courtesy flusher, as White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest once hinted, he uses at least twice as much water per visit to the mens room as the average American. This, coupled with the obvious breaks in productivity, has cost taxpayers a whopping $4.1 billion.  This is simply unacceptable, Florida senator and GOP presidential candidate Marco Rubio told Real News Right Now. This is the kind of imprudent overzealous spending that I intend to do away with. Senator Rubio said he and other Republican congressmen -in an effort to save taxpayers a buck or two, often wear adult diapers while on Capitol Hill. Its uncomfortable but from a moral standpoint, its the right thing to do. We as elected officials owe that much to our constituents."

33,Fake,"BREAKING  Dems Caught Counting Hillary Votes 6 TIMES In THIS City, TIME FOR PRISON! It turns out that the election may have been rigged after all. Its just that Hillary Clinton and her Democrats cant do any job right.  Entire precincts surrounding Detroit may be un-recountable, due to suspected voter fraud! Officials have found that, in hundreds of cases, the poll book numbers do not match the electronic voting machine printouts, as per The Detroit News.  Michigan state law holds that if a precinct is unable to be recounted, then the original count must stand.  Some of the problems may be due to biased elections staff. The machines used in Michigan, according to Detroit Elections Director Daniel Baxter, are quite old. In fact, 87 of the machines optical scanners broke on election day.  When there is such a problem with the machines, a ballot may get jammed in the scanner. The election staff then has to pull the ballot out and try again. This could result in a ballot being counted twice, or even six times, as the staff tries to get the ballot into the machine again and again.  The staff can manually erase the duplicate votes, but Baxter says that in many cases, [they] failed to do so. What, they forgot? Or perhaps they wanted to count the vote multiple times?  Of course, many of these precincts are strongly Democrat, at least according to historic voting trends. This includes Wayne County where Clinton received roughly two-thirds of the vote. If such widespread voter fraud has occurred, perhaps Michigan is a lot less blue than we thought.  There are other explanations for the vote discrepancies as well. As WND is reporting, Republican candidate Ken Crider has been keeping a close eye on his Districts elections process. Crider said, in a Facebook post, Pennys precinct, Detroit Precinct #152, had an unbroken seal and everything looked proper. The tag on the box said 306 and the book said 306 and the ticket said 306, so there should be 306 paper ballots on the box, right?  Well, when they pulled out the ballots, the stack seemed short, and when they finished separating the two page ballot to count the presidential page only, guess how many ballots were in the box? 304 no, 299 nope, 200 nada, how about 100 wrong again. There were only exactly 50 paper ballots in a locked sealed box that again was supposed to have 306. HMMMM. Crider is right to point out this mysterious circumstance.  If the seal was unbroken and there were no holes in the ballot box, then why was there an incorrect amount of ballots in there? It would be understandable to be off by one vote, but to be off by hundreds is highly suspicious and points, once again, to the election staff.  In my opinion, each of these staff members should be barred from working elections again. Whether through negligence or intention, something very bad has been going on here.

34,Satire,"Obama Could Seek Advice From Kerry, Gore About How to Lose to Unqualified Texan Tired and frustrated after spending so much time dealing with a bitterly divided Congress that needlessly created self-inflicted wounds to the U.S. economy, President Obama has begun to privately weigh the personal benefits of losing the 2012 presidential election. However, as the Republican field takes form, he is increasingly concerned that the number of weak candidates could force him to remain in the nations worst job whether he wants to or not.  One of the more difficult challenges for Obama would be losing to Texas Governor Rick Perry, who is currently considered co-frontrunner for the nomination. With a slew of controversial remarks  including statements about the unconstitutionality of Medicare and Social Security, as well as a proposal for seceding his state from the country he seeks to lead  a Perry nomination would all but guarantee that the President will be stuck dealing with the 534 most difficult people in America for another four years.  Realizing that even with a dismal sub-forty-percent approval rating, he is still favored to win re-election, President Obama has decided to consult Senator John Kerry and former Vice President Al Gore, the two men who know more than anyone else about losing presidential elections to unqualified Texas governors.  Its all about doing everything you can to show the American people you know nothing about what theyre dealing with, says former president-elect Al Gore. If the President talks about jobs while his opponents talk about tax cuts, that will make him look sensible. He needs to start talking more about why his opponents are weirdos or crazy people if he is seriously considering losing this thing.  I think his problem is hes too consistent, said Mr. Kerry. As an example, Kerry cited the presidents Afghanistan policy. He is doing exactly what he said he would do when he ran for president: focusing more troops fighting al Qaeda in the place they actually attacked us from. Its ridiculous to do the same thing you said you would four years ago if you want to lose that job. Instead he should bow to his critics on the left and withdraw immediately.  Not really looking like you want the job and failing to communicate why your opponent is dangerously incompetent are also tried-and-true techniques, added Gore. Hes off to a good start there, no question.  To keep his options open if he decides he wants another term but ends up competing against the most threatening of the GOP contenders, President Obama has begun consulting members of Bushs 2004 re-election campaign as well. When a reporter asked one of the courted staffers why the Obama campaign was interested, he replied he and his team have extensive experience working for an incumbent with terrible approval ratings while campaigning against a flip-flopper from Massachusetts."

I think we need to remember that as a result of our first-past-the-post system, only 39.5% of people voted for us, explained Trudeau in an interview with Le Devoir. This simply isnt a sufficient mandate to reform the system that produced this outcome.  Now I did say that the 2015 federal election would be the last election that uses first-past-the-post, but I was expecting at least half or two-thirds of Canadians to vote for me and my party. I should have crushed Saskatchewan and Alberta with 75% of the vote, but  again, due to factors out of our control at the time  could only muster five seats.  Trudeau also noted that many of his MPs didnt receive a majority of votes in their riding as a justification for backing away from his promise.  Just look at Minister of Democratic Institutions Maryam Monsef. She only won her riding by less that 44% of the vote! How can a Minister have the legitimacy of leading the change of our electoral system when 56% of her constituents voted against her?  The Prime Minister added that the only way for his government to gain legitimacy to carry out a new voting system, such as proportional representation or preferential balloting, would to re-elect a Liberal government using the current system several times over.  But voters shouldnt think the voter reform will never happen; well be strongly committed to the idea next time were in opposition."
