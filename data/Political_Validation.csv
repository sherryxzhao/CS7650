0,Satire,"TRUMP TAKES CRAP ON STAGE AS WORDS TAKE SOLID FORM CLEMSON, S.C. (SatireWire.com)  Donald Trumps increasingly toxic rhetoric reached its natural conclusion today as the Republican presidential frontrunner finished an explosive rant against Muslims, immigrants, minorities and the media by taking an actual shit on stage.  The crowd at a South Carolina rally initially fell silent, but quickly found its voice after realizing the candidate had, in that moment, managed to sum up his gritty campaign.  Wow, that was like everything hes ever said put into solid form! gushed 24-year-old Ty Leveren of Aiken, S.C.  He just did what were all thinking! added 55-year-old Randy Loafen of Columbia.   Trumps seemingly spontaneous evacuation came at the end of a particularly inflammatory 30-minute speech that simultaneously wound up his followers and unwound his bowels.   No one likes me saying it, but Ill say it, Trump told about 2,000 supporters. Muslims are evil, OK? Minorities are dangerous. Protesters? Horrible people. And worse than all that, Time magazine named that fat loser Angela Merkel as Person of the Year! Not me, Angela Merkel!   Doesnt that make you angry? he went on. Doesnt that make you furious? In fact, doesnt everything I say just make you want to to hold on. Ill show you!   Trump then lowered his suit pants to his ankles, leaned over his podium, and defecated.   Sensing unease in the silence that followed, the candidate quickly took control, strutting around the stage and nodding at his handiwork.   First of all, I have to say, wow, thats a great crap, Trump said. Maybe the best crap ever? People will say that. Because I crap like nobodys business, thats how good I am at crapping. Im full up to here with it. Doctors  the best specialists  have told me that. They say, Donald, youre so amazing. Youre so full of crap. So yeah, great, great crap.   But that steaming pile on the floor is more than that, folks, he continued. That incredible, steaming pile of billionaire gold is my message. Thats what I say about Islam! Thats what I say about liberal America! Thats what I say about Time magazine! That, folks, is what I have said, and will continue to say, right up to the day Im sworn in as your next president!   The crowd then burst into cheers, replacing its usual chant of Trump! Trump! Trump! with shouts of, Dump! Dump! Dump! But the business mogul demurred.   Folks folks folks, please, I cant, he intoned. Ive got to save some. Ive got other rallies today. But trust me, when I leave here, Im going to shit on Iowa, Im going to shit on New Hampshire, and when Im elected, Im going to shit on the whole country!   After the rally, Trump followers were ecstatic.   Trump is the real deal, said Cheryl Cramhoster of Mt. Pleasant, S.C. You know where he stands, and now we even know what he had for breakfast!   Karen Everton, 66, who drove to the rally from North Carolina, said the crude delivery of Trumps message would not dampen her enthusiasm for his presidential bid.   I dont know why he did it, but it makes me love him even more, she said. Its like, Donald Trump doesnt just say shit, he does shit. He literally does shit."
1,Fake,"Trump Takes Heat for 90 Minute Skype Session with Kim Jong-un President-elect Donald J. Trump received backlash from Democrats and members of the intelligence community on Thursday when it came to light that he engaged in a ninety-minute Skype video session last weekend with North Koreas Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un. Trump described the unprecedented discussion  which critics have called a clear violation of U.S. protocol  as extraordinary, saying the North Korean dictator appeared to be in very good health.  We had a wonderful conversation, the former reality TV star said of Kim. Hes very different from the way hes portrayed by the media and, you know, thats something I can relate to. Trump said he was surprised by exactly how much he and the Supreme Leader have in common. We both love meatloaf, Trump exclaimed. He said he eats it all the time. I said You ought to come to New York, Ill give you the best meatloaf youve ever had in your life.  Aside from sharing a love of baked ground meat, Trump and his North Korean counterpart discussed a wide range of issues including the economy, nuclear proliferation, and the reunification of North and South Korea. Trump, who repeatedly made the assertion during his campaign that more countries should have nuclear weapons, said he was willing to look into the possibility of loosening certain sanctions against the North Korean regime that might hinder the progress of its nuclear program. If they had that nuclear threat, Im sure it would be very good thing in terms of helping to unify the Korean peninsula, the president-elect said.  For his part, Mr. Trump said he offered praise for North Koreas single-party political system. I told him it was a very impressive thing to have such a successful political party that has lasted so long in that country. During his nearly two-hour long conversation with the Supreme Leader, Mr. Trump expressed an interest in implementing a similar single-party system in the United States as part of his effort to unite the country. I think it would be very good thing to have, said Trump, adding, Youd see a change in this country like you wouldnt believe.  Vice president-elect Mike Pence, who heads Trumps transition team, described the ninety-minute Skype session as very casual, telling The New York Times that its not unusual for world leaders to reach out following an election. This was the elected leader of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea  a democracy very similar to ours  offering his congratulations and good wishes, the vice president-elect explained. Mr. Pence said he believes the call will have little to no impact on U.S.-South Korean relations."
2,Satire,"TRUMP TO CREATE JOBS FOR UNSKILLED WHITE MALES WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)Fulfilling a promise that was a hallmark of his campaign, President-elect Donald J. Trump said on Thursday that on Day One of his Administration he would create jobs for two unskilled white males.  Appearing at a press conference flanked by the males, Trump assailed an economy that had left the two men behind.  These two guys are completely unskilled, unemployable, and angry, Trump said, as the two males glowered at the press corps. I, and I alone, can create jobs for people like them.  Gesturing vehemently at the two men, Trump underlined his last point. No oneI repeat, no onebut me is willing to give these two jobs, he said.  The two unskilled men profusely thanked Trump, and said that they had almost given up hope that anyone would ever hire them again.  Appearing on CNN, another unskilled white male, Corey Lewandowski, said that the two jobs Trump had created were just the beginning.  Almost everyone Donald Trump knows is an angry, unskilled white male, and hes going to give jobs to every last one of them, he said."
3,Real,"Trump presidency: What his new team teaches us As Donald Trump's 20 January inauguration draws closer, the president-elect's administration is starting to take shape. What does it tell us about what we can expect from the Trump presidency? Although the incoming president has to fill more than 4,000 executive branch jobs scattered across dozens of agencies, departments and bureaus, there are 21 top-level Cabinet positions that require Senate confirmation. So far the Trump transition team has announced nominees for 15 of the spots (a 16th, interior secretary, is reportedly going to Ryan Zinke of Montana). First, the basics. Of those 16, 11 are white men. For the first time since 1993, none of the top four departments - state, defence, treasury or justice - will be headed by a woman or a member of an ethnic minority group. Ben Carson, tapped for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, is the only African American. Elaine Chao (transportation) and Nikki Haley (UN ambassador) are the only Asians. Six have previously held elective office, and one - Ms Chao - has prior experience running a federal agency. That marks a significant change from past presidential administrations, which were well stocked with more experienced political hands. Mr Trump's Cabinet is a mix of rich businessmen, former military leaders and conservative true-believers. He may have campaigned as an anti-establishment outsider, but he's mostly surrounding himself with powerful, wealthy, influential men. While many may be outsiders to the game of elective politics, they're not exactly drawn from the ranks of the angry populist masses. Here's a closer look at how it all shakes out. You can follow Anthony on Twitter @awzurcher Captains of industry ExxonMobil head Rex Tillerson sits at a shareholder meeting in Dallas.Image copyrightGETTY IMAGES Image caption Rex Tillerson hopes to move from the ExxonMobil boardroom to White House Cabinet meetings American voters elected a businessman with no political experience as their president, and he's filled many of his top administration jobs with businessmen who have no political experience. Leading the way are Rex Tillerson, who has helmed the international energy conglomerate ExxonMobil since 2006, as secretary of state, and venture capitalist and former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin for Treasury. Other notable picks include the so-called ""king of bankruptcy"", Wilbur Ross, for commerce and fast food mogul Andrew Puzder at Labor. What we've learned: Mr Trump campaigned against a global elite that he said was stripping the working class of its wealth. By looking to Wall Street insiders and corporate chieftains for key administration spots, however, his post-election actions signal a decidedly different mentality. Read more about: Rex Tillerson - wildcard diplomat Steven Mnuchin - Secretary of the Treasury nominee Andrew Puzder - Secretary of Labor Here come the generals At one point during the campaign, Mr Trump quipped that he knew more about fighting the so-called Islamic State than many of the generals currently running US military operations. When it came time to fill out his national security apparatus, however, the president-elect has frequently turned to the military brass. General James Mattis testifies before CongressImage copyrightGETTY IMAGES Image caption James Mattis is a former general that Donald Trump likes James Mattis (defence) and John Kelly (homeland security) are both retired generals, as is Michael Flynn, who Mr Trump has slated for national security adviser (a position that does not require Senate confirmation). Taken individually, the picks are unremarkable - ex-military leaders sometimes wind up in the presidential administrations of both Democrats and Republicans. Colin Powell was George W Bush's secretary of state, and David Petraeus ran the Central Intelligence Agency under Barack Obama. Together, however, Mr Trump's picks give his administration a decidedly martial bent. While he may have mocked Mr Obama's generals, Mr Trump, who attended military school as a youth, seems inclined to favour the spit and polish of military leadership. The military is one of the few institutions still viewed favourably by the American public, and Mr Trump seems more than happy to march along with it. What we've learned: Candidate Trump often espoused a less interventionist foreign policy on the campaign trail, but President-elect Trump's decision to surround himself with generals could indicate he will be quicker on the trigger. Read more about: James Mattis - Secretary of Defense nominee John Kelly - Secretary of Homeland Security nominee Michael Flynn - National Security Advisor The vanquished Former presidential candidate Rick Perry once called Mr Trump a cancer on the Republican Party. Ben Carson, another primary opponent, questioned the business mogul's religious faith. Now Mr Trump has chosen both to head Cabinet departments in his administration. Donald Trump and Ben Carson slap hands at a presidential debate.Image copyrightGETTY IMAGES Image caption Donald Trump has named Ben Carson to his presidential team There's a certain amount of irony in Mr Perry's selection, given that he is slotted to head the Department of Energy, which he famously forgot the name of when listing Cabinet-level posts he'd cut during a 2008 Republican primary debate. Although Mr Trump has only named two former adversaries to his administration, he's also rumoured to be considering former computer executive Carly Fiorina for an intelligence agency post. Then there's New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who was reportedly offered several Cabinet-level positions after being passed over for attorney general. He's a foe-turned-friend who now, it seems, has been forgotten. What we've learned: Facing off against Mr Trump in the past isn't necessarily a deal-breaker for the president-elect, but a subsequent bent knee - offered both by Mr Carson and Mr Perry - is a key to bygones being bygones. Read more about: Rick Perry - Secretary of Energy nominee Ben Carson - Secretary of Housing and Urban Development nominee Congressman Tom Price presides over a House Budget Committee hearing.Image copyrightGETTY IMAGES Image caption Tom Price, chair of the House Budget Committee, is a Washington power player The insiders According to a recent story in Politico, Mr Trump's transition team has been beset by conflicts between establishment party players, led by incoming chief-of-staff Reince Priebus, and the conservative outsiders who helped run the Trump campaign. In a number of Cabinet positions, it appears the establishment landed the people they wanted. Tom Price, slated for Health and Human Services, is a member of the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives. Betsy DeVos, heading to education, is a long-time conservative activist and Republican Party donor. Elaine Chao served as labour secretary under President George W Bush and is married to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, considered a party rising star, is the nominee for US ambassador to the United Nations. Given that Mr Trump is likely to be a hands-off president when it comes to the day-to-day management of his administration, department heads will wield considerable power over the next four years. While the president-elect has said there are portions of Barack Obama's healthcare reform that he likes, for instance, chances are Mr Price will use his health secretary authority to strip the programme of much of its power. While he may sit down with former Vice-President Al Gore to talk climate change, his Environmental Protection Agency nominee, Scott Pruitt, is an outspoken critic - and legal opponent - of the agency he will head. What we've learned: Mr Trump railed against the political establishment on the campaign trail, but some of his nominees are very comfortable in the Washington ""swamp"". The tension between the insiders and the outsiders in the Trump transition team is likely to continue well into his presidency.

Linda McMahon, who gave more than $7m to the Trump campaign and affiliated political groups, is his pick to head the Small Business Administration. (She is also the largest donor to the Trump family's charitable foundation.) Another Trump donor, Todd Ricketts, has landed a deputy position in the Commerce Department. Meanwhile, some early, outspoken Trump advocates were passed over for plum positions - including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin and former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown. They emerged from the political graveyard to take an early gamble on Mr Trump, but they have yet to be rewarded for their efforts. What we've learned: While fiery speeches and television appearances are nice, one of the quickest ways to Mr Trump's corridors of power appears to be with an open chequebook."
4,Fake,"Obama Signs Executive Order Declaring Investigation Into Election Results; Revote Planned For Dec. 19th WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP)  Following the results of Tuesday nights election, President Obama has signed Executive Order 13805, which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on December 19th. Obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day, too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted, equipment failures, as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically.  People all over the country have been flooding my office with calls, telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers, Obama told reporters. Many have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a Hillary Clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as President. This was especially bad in areas of Florida and North Carolina where there are high numbers of Latino and African American voters. We must investigate these claims. The margin of victory is too close to call, and the outcome of this election is too important. There is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for Trump.  Under the Presidents order, the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted, and all poll workers who took part in Tuesdays election will be subjected to strict background checks. This process is expected to take 30 days. In precincts where the Department of Justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred, new elections will be held on Dec. 19th, with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college.  Not surprisingly, Donald Trump is not happy with the presidents decision.  Crooked Hillary lost this election fair and square. They tried to rig this election against me, but the American people didnt allow that to happen. President Obama doesnt care about what the American people want. I said the system was rigged all along, and this proves I was right.  The president also said that the DOJ will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college.  We have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states. We still need to investigate these claims, but if they are true, we will take all the appropriate actions necessary.  Paul Horner, a professor of political science at UCLA, believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election.  Most people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the United States, but there is nothing in the constitution that says that. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 200,000 votes, but because of the electoral college, she still lost. That decision is reserved solely for the 538 electors who meet in their respective states on December 19th. What the people are actually voting for are their states electors, not for the President. Though the system is odd and unfair, it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is, with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching. That does not mean, however, that it will continue to work just fine in the future. The way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways, this recent election being one of them.  Political Analyst Matt Daemon told ABC News that he agrees with the Presidents Executive Order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether.  [The electoral college] is a fking joke; we should be using the popular vote instead. It may have made sense in 1788, but so did the three fifths compromise. Everyone should have an equal vote, and thats just not the case with the electoral college. You know what the electoral college gave us? It gave us George W. Bush. It gave us a war in Iraq, and the worst recession since the great depression. Its time to bring our system into the 21st century. I hope Obama fixes this, because president Trump is going to be a nightmare.  Obama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward.  Were going to investigate the FBI into their role in all of this, Obama said. Why did FBI director James Comey on Sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against Clinton after reviewing all of her emails; declaring Hillary Clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election? Why wasnt this news released earlier? How many votes were lost because of this? Obama said. If all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in December, a recount will be ordered.  If you have any questions about the recount or the special December 19th election, you can call the Obama administrations special election hotline at (785) 273-0325."
5,Fake,"ISIS Leadership Among Top GOP Campaign Contributors WASHINGTON, D.C.  Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and other members of the Islamic States leadership council have provided more than five million dollars in campaign contributions to Republican presidential candidates this year, according to a campaign finance report released by the Republican National Committee last week.  According to the report, more than half of the GOPs leading presidential contenders including Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, have received upwards of one million dollars from the Islamic State. However, specific standards set in place by the Federal Election Committee limit individual donors to a maximum contribution of $2,700 per year. In addition, the FEC strictly prohibits foreign nationals from making any sort of contribution toward elections held in the United States.  To the delight of the RNC, the Islamic State has found a convenient loophole to bypass these restrictions. Using the same global financial networks already in place meant to provide funding to its various terror operations, ISIS is able to funnel cash through a number of waypoints before it reaches sympathetic Americans residing in the United States. Then, using funds provided by the Islamic State, individuals simply write a check for the maximum donation allowed, payable to a presidential candidates campaign.  Its really an ingenious system, said James Arevalo, assistant campaign manager for Senator Ted Cruz. Obviously the senator doesnt see eye to eye with the Islamic State on some issues, Arevalo told CNN, continuing, That said, we certainly share very similar beliefs and values with ISIS, particularly when it comes to womens rights and gun control. Arevalo added that candidates have a moral obligation to meet the uphold the values of supporters and donors alike.  In the wake of the nations most recent mass shooting that left fourteen people dead and another twenty-two injured in San Bernardino, California, the Republican party, at the request of the Islamic State and the National Rifle Association, once again blocked legislation that would enact stricter gun control policies in the United States.  Currently there are an estimated 700,000 people on the U.S. governments terror watch list with several thousand residing in the United States. Legislation proposed by Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein would have prevented terror suspects, felons, and individuals with a history of mental illness from purchasing firearms.  House Speaker Paul Ryan, who opposed the legislation, told CBS This Morning that the act of blocking suspected terrorists and convicted felons from legally obtaining firearms would infringe upon the rights of law-abiding citizens."
6,Real,"Judge unseals warrant for search of Anthony Weiner's computer A federal judge in New York has unsealed the search warrant obtained by the FBI to search Anthony Weiners computer for emails related to Secretary Clintons private server.  The warrant was issued on Oct. 30, just two days after FBI Director James Comey had sent a letter to Congress revealing the possible existence of new emails related to the FBIs investigation into Hillary Clintons use of a private email server.  The Department of Justice had previously announced that the investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information was closed, with a decision not to bring charges against anyone. Comeys letter to Congress said the new emails were discovered as part of an unrelated investigation, but he did not name or give details about the other investigation.  FBI combs through Weiner's computer According to the warrant, law enforcement officials had asked the judge to authorize the search of a silver Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Series laptop computer. The warrant states that those officials had information indicating that there were thousands of emails on the laptop that could be related to the Clinton investigation.  The FBIs application for the search warrant said that the laptop had never been authorized for the storage or transmission of classified or national defense information and that a complete forensic analysis and review of the device would allow the FBI to determine whether classified information had been mishandled or if the device had been hacked.  The warrant was unsealed after E. Random Schoenberg sued to unseal the search warrant. He made it clear he was not interested in the unrelated investigation and was only seeking the warrant for the emails related to Secretary Clinton.  Huma Abedin challenges the FBI In deciding whether to unseal the warrant, the judge noted that Clinton has little remaining privacy interest in the release of her documents identify her as the subject of her investigation.  The Department of Justice initially opposed the unsealing, then withdrew its opposition and instead asked only that the documents be unsealed with certain redactions. The warrant was redacted to hide the identity of the subject of that other investigation  who has been independently confirmed to be Anthony Weiner. The redactions also protect the identity of the law enforcement agents who worked on the case and applied for the warrant.  Lawyers for Huma Abedin filed a letter in the case saying that the government never provided Abedin or her estranged ex-husband Anthony Weiner with a copy of the warrant.  Under federal law the officer executing the warrant must give a copy to the person whose property is taken.  This case is slightly more complicated by the fact that the laptop had already been confiscated for the other investigation, a sexting scandal involving Weiner and a minor."
7,Fake,"20 Black Lives Protesters Claim They Were Jumped By 4 Trump Supporters  Is It a HOAX? Twenty millennial snowflakes want us to believe they got beat down by FOUR Trump supporters. And these alleged victims have ZERO evidence to support their claims.  Peter Soeller, a New York City student and civil rights activist, tweeted that he and approximately 20 of his pals were attacked by Donald Trump supporters after they left a party on Saturday night, BizPac Review reports. According to Soeller, his buddies were merely walking down the street chanting and laughing when four or five Trump supporters suddenly appeared out of nowhere.  The Trump supporters confronted us and assaulted us yelling, Blue Lives Matter Get out of my country, calling us faggots and commies as they wailed on us, Soeller tweeted. So, there were 20 millennials on their way home from a Black Lives Matter party and not a single one of them had a cellphone to whip out and take a few seconds of video of the alleged beating?  Millennials are rarely ever separated from their phonesdoing so could lead to them missing the chance for yet another inane selfie. It is beyond illogical to think 20 college kids would leave for a night out and not one of them had a working phone.  Soeller and his friends were on their way home from the Decolonize This Place party when they were allegedly stopped by a small handful of Trump supporters. Soeller claims he and two others were the most seriously injured.  No more pettiness, time to organize, Soeller also said in his tweet. He claimed the roving mini horde of Trump supporters were trolling the streets looking for queer anti-Trump activists.  The anti-police activist also made a baseless claim about the four or five attackers who supposedly beat up the 20 millennials. Soeller claimed the Trump supporters were off-duty cops.  Why did Soeller leap to such a wild accusation? The build of the attackers and the way they took us down, convinced the college student the unknown men had to be police officers.  Trump supporter attack stories appear to be all the rage since the election. The elusive Trump fans wander around city streets in search of millennials to whomp on  at least that is what the snowflakes claim.  One such story has already been debunked. A Muslim college student who claimed she was attacked by Trump supporters who hurled Islamic slurs at her was actually just trying to stay out of trouble with her strict parents.  The Muslim girl had stayed out too late in the evening with her boyfriend and needed a sympathetic story to tell the folks. She went into great detail when describing the alleged attack to police officers, who quickly realized far too many holes existed in her tall tale.  Well just have to wait and see if such holes start piling up in this case. Im sure the involved police officers will be paying extra close attention in the case of this cop-hating agitator and his 20 friends, who couldnt take on four or five cop built guys.

13,Fake,"Top Black Lives Matter Activist: We Will Incite Riots Everywhere if Trump Wins Dear white peopleniggas such as myself are fully hell bent on inciting riots everywhere we go  UPDATE: Poe deleted his tweet and then claimed that he never made the comments. The tweet is archived here and a screenshot of it appears below.  Hes now whining about slander. Talk crap, then play the victim when you get challenged on your crap. Same process EVERY time with social justice warriors.  Prominent Black Lives Matter activist and rapper Tef Poe has a message for white people: If Donald Trump wins the presidency, niggas will incite riots everywhere.  Dear white people if Trump wins young niggas such as myself are fully hell bent on inciting riots everywhere we go. Just so you know, Poe tweeted today.  He followed up with another promise: Trump wins aint no more rules fammo. Weve been too nice as is.  Poe is by no means a nobody, he has appeared in innumerable articles charting the rise of Black Lives Matter and was credited with coining the phrase, This aint your grandparents civil rights movement.  The rapper was one of the co-founders of Hands Up United, a social justice organization that emerged after the death of Michael Brown that was responsible for coordinating large BLM protests in the St. Louis area.  St. Louis was hit by riots in August last year as police were forced to use tear gas to disperse demonstrators who threw bricks and bottles at officers.  The hands up, dont shoot! mantra was later discredited by DNA and autopsy evidence that confirmed Michael Brown did not have his hands up when he was shot by Officer Darren Wilson.  Poes threat to incite riots comes on the same day as it emerged that some of the radical groups involved in shutting down Donald Trumps rally in Chicago last week are planning a mass civil disobedience movement beginning next month.  Donald Trump himself also warned that any attempt by the GOP establishment to steal the nomination from him may result in civil unrest.  I think you would have riots. I think you would have riots, Trump told CNNs Chris Cuomo this morning. I think you would see problems like youve never seen before. I think bad things would happen. I really do.  Trump was quickly blasted by many sectors of the media for invoking the prospect of riots, a sentiment that wasnt seen immediately after the riots in Ferguson, Missouri, when publications like Time Magazine argued that rioting was a justifiable form of protest."

New York Times  Democrats may have lost the white working class vote for generations. Its Obamas fault.  And just this week Barack Obama was out again railing against white working class Americans for his partys woes. iPatriot reported:  Obama also blamed Rush Limbaugh, Fox News, and the NRA for distracting the country from his message of hope and change, particularly during the holiday season.  If were not actually out there changing the narrative like we are during campaigns, then folks in a lot of these communities, what theyre hearing is Obama wants to take away my guns, he said.  Obama is disrespecting my culture and is primarily concerned with coastal elites and minorities. Ah yes, the problem was you couldnt mindlessly brainwash the country Barack, not that your message was fundamentally anti-American.  Obama defended the robbers and hosted Black Lives Matter in the White House.  The Black Lives matter led to several police deaths, lootings and burned businesses.

15,Fake,"BREAKING: Hillary Clintons Nomination is a LIE and WE HAVE PROOF!!!! Hillary Clinton has reached the 2,383 delegates today. This is what she needed to win the party nomination for the 2016 Presidential race. She is officially the first woman nominee of a major U.S. political party. The Associated Press released a new count of her pledged delegates and showed that she has reached the magic number.  *** This is an outright lie.  Besides being suspiciously announced right before the California primary tomorrow. A spokesman for Bernie Sanders, Michael Briggs said Monday that the number that was released today depends on superdelegates. This means that this is not an official victory.  It is unfortunate that the media, in a rush to judgement, are ignoring the Democratic National Committees clear statement that it is wrong to count the votes of superdelegates before they actually vote at the convention this summer, he said.  *** What else would you expect from CROOKED Hillary?    Briggs says that Sanders could potentially change the minds of those superdelegates before the Democratic Convention.  Secretary Clinton does not have and will not have the requisite number of pledged delegates to secure the nomination, he said. She will be dependent on superdelegates who do not vote until July 25 and who can change their minds between now and then. They include more than 400 superdelegates who endorsed Secretary Clinton 10 months before the first caucuses and primaries and long before any other candidate was in the race.  Our job from now until the convention is to convince those superdelegates that Bernie is by far the strongest candidate against Donald Trump.  The Clinton campaign tweeted the following:  In another recent tweet, Clinton said that we are on the brink of a historic moment, but we still have work to do.  We can agree with that statement. We are on a historic moment and Hillary Clinton is about to get SHREDDED by Donald Trump in the worst presidential sweeps in history. (h/t The Blaze)"

17,Fake,"REPORT: HILLARY IGNITES SOROS-FUNDED PURPLE REVOLUTION AGAINST TRUMP While blasting so-called fake news on Thursday, Hillary Clinton once again wore the color purple which signifies George Soros color revolution against the Donald Trump presidency. Clinton, who has deep ties to Soros, also wore purple during her concession speech on Nov. 9. Soros, a socialist billionaire best known for breaking the British pound in 1992, has funded government overthrows, known as color revolutions, in Ukraine, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan and other countries in the former Soviet bloc, the Middle East and North Africa. And now hes trying to do the same using far-left radicals in the U.S., if Hillarys recent penchant for the color purple is any indication. But why purple? Its the color resulting from mixing red and blue  and Clinton and others pushing the upcoming purple revolution will likely justify it as the unification of the divided red and blue states of America. Anytime globalist politicians embrace a color, be on guard for a revolution bearing that particular hue, reported D.C. journalist Wayne Madsen. On the day after the election that propelled Donald Trump into the White House, Hillary and Bill Clinton entered the ballroom of the Moonie Unification Church-owned New Yorker hotel in midtown Manhattan adorned in the color purple. Mrs. Clinton wore a pant suit with purple lapels and a purple blouse, while Bill Clinton wore a purple tie. Already many of the nationwide protests since the election were coordinated by the Soros-funded activist group MoveOn.org. When it comes to themed revolutions, the Sorosites have refined the art to a science, Madsen added. While Mrs. Clinton called for uniting the nation in her concession speech, Soross minions took the streets in protests, some turning violent, across the United States. Clinton, who received millions of dollars in campaign contributions from Soros, showed her real intentions by signaling the start of Soross Purple Revolution in the United States."
18,Fake,"Dobbs  WikiLeaks Shows Obama Lied  Knew About And Used Clinton Illegal Server Lou Dobbs focuses on the prominent role the month of March has played in the Clinton email and other scandals. He calls it The troublesome ides of March, especially March of last year. For a number of reasons that month has proven to be pivotal in the scandal over her use of a private server to conduct official State Department business, communicating by email over that server.  He points out that it was the New York Times that broke the email story back in March of 2015, with the latest batch of WikiLeaks emails indicating that the Clinton team has been scrambling ever since. Dobbs plays a clip of Obama lying about his knowledge of Clinton using a personal email account to conduct government business.  673-lou-dobbs-clinton-1200  In an interview Obama was asked, Mr. president, when did you first learn that Hillary Clinton used an email system outside the US government for official business while she was Secretary of State? Obama responded with a blatant lie, saying, The same time everybody else learned it through news reports.  Mr. Dobbs points out the fact that Everybody else, however, didnt believe the president when he said that. And Clintons top aide, Cheryl Mills, certainly knew better. It was she who told Podesta, We need to clean this up, noting the president has emails from Hillary that do not say State.gov.'  Dobbs goes on to tell his audience that Clinton had just days earlier conspired with Obama to hold back emails despite being subpoenaed by Congress. In that instance Podesta cities executive privilege. Dobbs points out that March was also when the firm managing her server, Platte River Networks, deleted her email archive using Bleachbit, despite that subpoena.  March was also the month that Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe suggested that the wife of a strategically placed FBI official run for the Virginia State Senate. He also donated $467,000 to her campaign and then promoted him to the number two position in the FBI, in charge of the Clinton investigation.

19,Satire,"ELECTION CHANGES POLITICAL LANDSCAPE INSIDE MARRIAGE RICHMOND, VA (SatireWire.com)  Donald Trumps shock election has dramatically shifted the political landscape in the home of Deirdre and Scott Taylor of Richmond, Va., as Scotts vote for Trump has caused Deirdre to redraw the physical and emotional boundaries of their relationship, in lieu of just killing him.  Due to the incomprehensible votes cast by certain members of this household electorate, I am shifting policy to address the very real threat that my husband Scott is an idiot, said Deirdre Taylor of Richmond, Va. As a result, I am today redistricting our house such that Scott resides only his areas, specifically the basement, the garage, the couch  every night  and the yard, although not in areas of the yard where I can see him or hear him or smell him.  The bedroom, she added, is now the equivalent of the post-industrial Midwestern states that went for Trump.  Its a place of anger and sadness that was once a thriving hub of activity but now thats gone and its never coming back, she said.  The Taylors, who have been married for 12 years, are among thousands of couples in the U.S. that are struggling to adapt to the seismic shift in their once-united states, a shift brought on by a vote in which the women voted for Hillary Clinton and the men chose Trump.  Ironically, many of these white, suburban males now find themselves holding the status of the women and minorities Trump often railed against.  Ive talked it over with Deirdre and our friends, and my husband Kirk and his buddies will now be marginalized, under-served and, politically and in all other ways, impotent, said Kora Ann Snelling, a neighbor of Deirdres. Using terms Mr. Trump and my husband can understand, theyll be vaginally bankrupt.  For the Taylors, the shift became apparent late on election night as they watched the results come in.  I asked Scott if he voted for Hillary, and he said, Um Deirdre recalled.  Thats all I said! Um, Scott explained.  Because you couldnt bring yourself to admit you voted for a race-baiting, misogynistic pathological liar who draws support from white nationalists and boasts of sexual assault! Deirdre countered.  But I just wanted to make American great again, Scott protested.  Why dont you make the doghouse great again instead? Deirdre replied.  We dont have a dog, Scott pointed out.  Well get Mexico to build you one! she said.  While Trump doesnt take office until January, Deirdre has already taken steps to institute a core tenet of her new policy.  I have completed a virtual border wall between myself and the father of our children  our two daughters!  and if he so much as attempts to approach he will be treated as an enemy combatant, she said.  At press time, Deirdre was reading the children a book about tolerance while Scott was trapped in a hell of his own making."
20,Real,"Leak reveals Rex Tillerson was director of Bahamas-based US-Russian oil firm Rex Tillerson, the businessman nominated by Donald Trump to be the next US secretary of state, was the long-time director of a US-Russian oil firm based in the tax haven of the Bahamas, leaked documents show.  Tillerson  the chief executive of ExxonMobil  became a director of the oil companys Russian subsidiary, Exxon Neftegas, in 1998. His name  RW Tillerson  appears next to other officers who are based at Houston, Texas; Moscow; and Sakhalin, in Russias far east.   Who is Donald Trumps secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson? The leaked 2001 document comes from the corporate registry in the Bahamas. It was one of 1.3m files given to the Germany newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung by an anonymous source. The registry is public but details of individual directors are typically incomplete or missing entirely.  Though there is nothing untoward about this directorship, it has not been reported before and is likely to raise fresh questions over Tillersons relationship with Russia ahead of a potentially stormy confirmation hearing by the US senate foreign relations committee. Exxon said on Sunday that Tillerson was no longer a director after becoming the companys CEO in 2006.  ExxonMobils use of offshore regimes  while legal  may also jar with Trumps avowal to put America first.  Tillersons critics say he is too close to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and that his appointment could raise potential conflicts of interest.  ExxonMobil is the worlds largest oil company and has for a long time been eyeing Russias vast oil and gas deposits. Tillerson currently has Exxon stock worth more than $200m.   Since his nomination, Tillersons Russia ties have become a source of bipartisan concern. In 2013, Putin awarded him the Russian Order of Friendship. Tillerson is close to Igor Sechin, the head of Russian state oil company Rosneft and the de facto second most powerful figure inside the Kremlin. A hardliner, Sechin is ex-KGB.  Tillersons award followed a 2011 deal between ExxonMobil and Rosneft to explore the Kara Sea, in Russias Arctic.  It was put on hold in 2014 after the Obama administration imposed wide-ranging sanctions against Russia. The sanctions were punishment for Putins Crimea annexation that spring and Russias undercover invasion of eastern Ukraine.  The ban covers the US sharing of sophisticated offshore and shale oil technology. Exxon was supposed to halt its drilling with Rosneft. The firm successfully pleaded with the US Treasury department to delay the ban by a few weeks, with the Kremlin threatening to seize its rig. In this brief window Exxon discovered a major Arctic field with some 750m barrels of new oil.  Tillerson has criticised the US governments policy on Russia. In 2014 he told Exxons annual meeting that we do not support sanctions. He added: We always encourage the people who are making those decisions to consider the very broad collateral damage of who they are really harming.  It is widely assumed by investors that the new Trump administration will drop sanctions. This would allow the Kara joint venture to resume, boosting Exxons share price and yielding potential profits in the tens of billions of dollars. According to company records, Tillerson currently owns $218m of stock. His Exxon pension is worth about $70m.  Vladimir Putin and Rex Tillerson shaking hands Facebook Twitter Pinterest Vladimir Putin awarded Rex Tillerson the Russian Order of Friendship. Photograph: Alexei Nikolsky/Tass The Senate foreign relations committee is currently split 10 to 9 between Republicans and Democrats. But several heavyweight Republicans, including John McCain, have raised doubts about Tillersons nomination and his lack of experience to be Americas top diplomat after four decades spent exclusively in the oil industry.  Republican senator Marco Rubio  who sits on the committee  said on Tuesday that he had serious concerns about giving Tillerson the job. Rubio praised him as a respected businessman but said that the next secretary of state must be someone who views the world with moral clarity [and who] has a clear sense of Americas interests.  Tillerson is likely to get rid of his Exxon stock if the narrowly Republican-majority Senate confirms his appointment.  Controversy over his links with Russia comes at a time when the topic is politically red hot, after the CIA said earlier this month that Kremlin hackers had stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee and top Democrats in order to help Trump. The president-elect has dismissed the CIAs assessment, calling it ridiculous. The Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, says Putin targeted her for reasons of personal revenge.  As well as on oil and gas, the Obama administration has imposed personal sanctions on Putins friends, including Sechin. Sechin has said that one of his ambitions is to ride the roads in the United States on motorcycles with Tillerson. Currently, Sechin is forbidden from entering the country.  This new revelation about Tillersons directorship sheds light on the use by multinational companies of contrived offshore structures, now under scrutiny following Aprils massive Panama Papers leak.  Exxon Neftegass most important oil and gas project is Sakhalin-1. It is located in the sub-Arctic, off the frozen and difficult-to-access north-east coast of Russias Sakhalin island. This is 10,700km (6,650 miles) away from the subsidiarys official business home in Nassau, the semi-tropical capital of the Bahamas. The Bahamas is notorious for secrecy and has a corporate tax rate of zero.  The documents from the Bahamas corporate registry were shared by Sddeutsche Zeitung with the Guardian and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC. They show that Exxon registered at least 67 companies in the secretive tax haven, covering operations in countries from Russia to Venezuela to Azerbaijan.   Robert Gates criticises 'laid-back' US response to Russia election hack Read more Exxon Neftegas features in about 25 leaked offshore documents. The oil firm was incorporated in 1998 by a law firm in Nassau, Higgs & Johnson. Another veteran law firm, Lobosky Management Ltd, subsequently took over as registered agent. The company secretary, Sophia Kishinevsky, signed the paperwork and made annual filings.  Exxon said it had no comment on whether Tillerson should now divest his Exxon holdings and resign from his positions with all Exxon entities. It said the oil firm had incorporated some of its affiliates in the Bahamas because of simplicity and predictability.  It is not done to reduce tax in the country where the company operates, Exxon said. Incorporation of a company in the Bahamas does not decrease ExxonMobils tax liability in the country where the entity generates its income.  The firm was one of the largest taxpayers in the world, with an effective global tax rate in 2015 of 34%, it said. Its effective tax rate over the past three years  2013, 2014, 2015  was 43%, it added. This compared favourably with other Fortune 100 companies, which have substantially lower effective tax rates than ExxonMobil."
21,Fake,"Donald Trump Tweets Image Of His Penis  WARNING: Graphic Content WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP)  Donald Trump has broken all kinds of norms during his presidential campaign, but he just went to a whole new level this morning by tweeting what is supposedly an image of his private-parts. The tweet was quickly deleted but not before being retweeted over 5,000 times.  The tweet comes in response to comments made by Marco Rubio and others about the size of Donald Trumps hands.  Look at those hands, are they small hands? Trump told the audience at his rally in Detroit back in March. And he [Rubio] referred to my hands, if theyre small something else must be small. I guarantee you theres no problem, I guarantee it.  Donald Trump's penis size A screenshot of Donald Trumps tweet captured by ABC News just minutes before it was deleted. Hes always calling me Little Marco. And Ill admit hes taller than me, Rubio told ABC News. Hes like 62, which is why I dont understand why his hands are the size of someone who is 52, Rubio said in Virginia on Sunday. And you know what they say about men with small hands? You cant trust them.  The New York billionaire has heard similar comments about his hands or, more precisely, his fingers, for years.  As Vanity Fairs Graydon Carter recalled online last year: Just to drive him a little bit crazy, I took to referring to him as a short-fingered vulgarian in the pages of Spy magazine. That was more than a quarter of a century ago.  Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she isnt surprised by Trumps actions.  Donald Trump is an ego-maniac, racist, bigot, who brings out the worst in the worst people, Bradley said. We get donations from poor people, the middle class and the upper class all the time. Since Donald Trump is the least charitable billionaire in the entire world, we expect no donations from that dick pic tweeting pervert anytime soon.  Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told reporters that he agrees with Trumps actions.  If everyone says you have a small penis, you dont keep it in your pants, you dont hide it; you prove them wrong! This is exactly what a real president should do! Praise Donald Trump! Praise Fappy!  David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this about Donald Trump is accomplishing.  You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the gender reassignment surgery my wife Barbara has always wanted since she was a little boy, Mikkleson said. We claim to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well, but thats just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and thats it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and Im only telling you this for legal reasons. For example, do you remember that recent article we wrote debunking a story which claimed Scientology lost its tax-exempt status? Did you actually read our story? Who is the name of the person responsible for the hoax? What is the actual website URL? We claim to know it, but no real information is posted by us. Mikkelson continues, It is common for us to rewrite a story were debunking if we dont like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a persons name from the original article and then called him a liar, oh the hypocrisy, but it is so funny at the same time! We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search that locates the actual article will show that our disclaimer is 100% fabricated. Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money, Mikkelson laughs. And lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours. Plus, I know for our writers like Kim LaCapria, it is way more fun for them to cause controversy than report the facts; it results in more visitors. Kim LaCapria and Jeff Zarronandia go as far as accusing the site that the story originated from as a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false news stories. The thing that is troubling about these claims and what Snopes and our authors are known for. We dont list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up any of our claims; Its just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and I only tell you this for legal reasons. I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work? To be honest, Id say in a given week I probably only do about fifteen minutes of real, actual, work.  ABC News reached out to Trumps campaign for comment about the x-rated tweet and at the time of this press release did not receive a response."
